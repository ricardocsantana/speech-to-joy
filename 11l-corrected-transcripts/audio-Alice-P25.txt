00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,259 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,559 [User]
Hi, Alice. I can try. 

00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:12,859 [Robot]
I'd like to talk about when lying might be acceptable. When do you think it's okay to tell a lie? 

00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:19,319 [User]
I think it's okay to tell a lie when it risks hurting someone's feelings. 

00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:24,699 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:31,840 [User]
Oh, not off the top of my head, but I probably told a little white lie just to, uh, make the person
feel better. 

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,799 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? 

00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:51,840 [User]
That's a little hard to really comment. Uh, but I personally wouldn't risk hurting someone's
feelings. I don't like the, don't like the feeling of potentially hurting someone like that. 

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,759 [Robot]
What about lying to protect someone from danger? Can you think of a time when that might be okay? 

00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:11,779 [User]
If it's protecting someone from danger, yes. Can't think of anything specifically to mind, but, uh,
yeah, I think it's okay to lie if it means protecting somebody. 

00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:15,239 [Robot]
What are some other situations where you think lying might be justified? 

00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:25,719 [User]
I don't know. Getting out of a parking ticket maybe? (laughs) If you're trying to save money. 

00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:34,759 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep certain secrets from people? What types of secrets
would you choose to keep? 

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,299 [User]
It's- 

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:35,319 [Robot]
Why? 

00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:52,299 [User]
It's okay to, uh, to keep secrets, and it means that the person that's told you the secret has
trusted you, um, and you don't wanna b- betray their trust. Betray their trust, I should say
(laughs). Yeah. 

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:59,339 [Robot]
Can you think of a time when you chose to keep a secret for someone? How did it make you feel to
hold onto that secret? 

00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:10,179 [User]
Kinda easy. (laughs) Yeah, I don't have any interest in spreading gossip. (laughs) 

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:17,599 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds
of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:29,279 [User]
Beneficial or harmful? (laughs) That's a tough one, but I think it's fair to let kids believe in
Santa. 

00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:39,959 [Robot]
How do you feel about lies that are told to avoid doing something you don't wanna do? 

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:47,439 [User]
Uh, I think in that if I don't wanna do it, I would still normally tell the truth. Have you got an
example? 

00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,579 [Robot]
What do you think about secret agents who lie as part of their jobs? 

00:02:51,579 --> 00:03:00,979 [User]
I guess it's protect, it's, it's to protect national security, so I guess they have to. 

00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:11,559 [Robot]
What if lying helps navigate cultural differences? For example, if you're in a country where it's
polite to say you enjoyed a meal that you didn't, how would you handle that? 

00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:22,379 [User]
I would just say the meal was fine. (laughs) If I, even if I didn't really, uh, enjoy it. 

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:29,699 [Robot]
What about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:43,959 [User]
If telling the truth could damage the relationship? Well, I guess you should always try and tell the
truth. Otherwise, you don't get your feelings heard, but it, uh, it depends on the, the com- the,
the context. 

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,399 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:49,419 [User]
I don't know. (laughs) What would you do? 

00:03:49,419 --> 00:04:06,999 [Robot]
In a situation where telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, what approach do you think you
would take to handle it? 

00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:10,059 [User]
Sorry, say that again? 

00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:18,339 [Robot]
What approach do you think you would take to handle it if you found yourself in a situation where
telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings? 

00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:39,059 [User]
It depends on the, the s- the, the size of the issue. If it's a small thing, I would probably lie to
protect someone's feelings, but if it's something more serious, then maybe they need to come to
terms, or they should come to terms with it. 

00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:51,959 [Robot]
That makes sense. Can you share an example of a time when you felt it was necessary to lie to
protect someone's feelings? 

00:04:51,959 --> 00:05:10,439 [User]
Probably someone asked their opinion on an item of clothing, and I would pro- made me say (laughs)
it looks great, but my real opinion was, uh, the opposite. (laughs) But if they liked it, then it's,
it's, it's... My opinion doesn't matter. (laughs) 

00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:19,739 [Robot]
It's important to be mindful of how our words can impact others. Have you ever had to keep a secret
to maintain trust in a relationship? 

00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:24,479 [User]
I, yeah. Sure. 

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,719 [Robot]
What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:36,559 [User]
Something that's confidential or very personal to someone, then I would keep that a secret. 

00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:41,039 [Robot]
Would you ever lie to authorities if a friend confided in you a secret? 

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:49,219 [User]
I wouldn't lie to the authorities. (laughs) 

00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,659 [Robot]
What about lies told to children, like the story of Santa Claus? 

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,139 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:53,139 --> 00:06:00,759 [Robot]
Do you... What about lies told to children, like the story of Santa Claus? Do you think these kinds
of lies can be beneficial or harmful? 

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:08,799 [User]
I mean, when you're a kid, they're beneficial, 'cause you wanna believe in the magic. 

00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:18,259 [Robot]
Definitely. The magic of childhood is a precious thing. How do you feel about lying to avoid tasks
you don't wanna do? 

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:27,639 [User]
I'd probably keel over and do the tasks anyway. (laughs) 

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:37,519 [Robot]
A strong work ethic is admirable. Can you think of a time when you had to make a difficult decision
about telling the truth or lying to avoid doing something you didn't want to do? 

00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:48,979 [User]
No. Maybe as a kid and I didn't wanna take the garbage out, but, uh, in the grand scheme of things,
no. 

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:59,399 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the story of the Tooth Fairy or the Easter
Bunny? Do you think these kinds of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,219 [User]
I think it's the same example as, uh, Santa Claus. 

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,999 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. 

00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:08,199 [User]
(laughs) 

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,039 [Robot]
Hope you have a truly great day.
