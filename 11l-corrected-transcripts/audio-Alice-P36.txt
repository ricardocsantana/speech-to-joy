00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:05,099 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,679 [User]
Hi, Alice. Yeah, sure. What do you need help with? 

00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,219 [Robot]
I'd like to discuss when lying might be acceptable. What are your thoughts on when it's okay to lie?


00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:36,700 [User]
Personally, I am pretty okay with a lot of white lies, so if it doesn't harm anyone. I also think
that lying is okay when it ultimately causes something good, but in instances where it is
unnecessary or has harm, you should not lie. 

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,919 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:53,000 [User]
Let me think. A time that I had a white lie? The thing is that I probably have small lies. 

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,739 [Robot]
When telling the truth could damage a relationship, what would you choose to do? 

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:11,379 [User]
Well, it depends on what the truth is. If it's a very heavy topic, then it's best to just tell the
truth and maybe the relationship will be damaged. 

00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,899 [Robot]
What's an example of a heavy topic for you? 

00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:36,219 [User]
I mean, I'm thinking it... When you say relationship, I instantly start thinking about a romantic
relationship, even though I know it doesn't have to entail that. And I'm thinking that if someone is
cheating on their significant other, they could lie to them to tr- they could lie to them to try to
preserve the relationship, but in that instance, that is too big of a topic, so they shouldn't. 

00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,439 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? 

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:48,579 [User]
If it is unnecessary, then you should just not mention it. If you think that someone looks bad... 

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:55,999 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds
of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:01:55,999 --> 00:02:07,899 [User]
That's interesting. No, I don't think that they're harmful. I think I'm okay with them, but
sometimes they're very unnecessary. But in... With Santa Clause- 

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,519 [Robot]
Is it okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:22,779 [User]
Yes, it's okay to keep secrets if it's personal information that people don't need to know. But... 

00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:27,379 [Robot]
Can you give an example of the type of personal information you would choose to keep as a secret? 

00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,639 [User]
I'm thinking if someone had a traumatic experience or maybe an injury. 

00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:39,119 [Robot]
What about lying to authorities if your friend confided in you about a secret? 

00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:45,459 [User]
It depends on what type of secret. If it is something illegal. 

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,979 [Robot]
What are some situations where lying might be justified, in your opinion? 

00:02:48,979 --> 00:03:00,859 [User]
I think lying is justified if it is for the greater good or if it's not necessary. 

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:05,519 [Robot]
What do you think about lying to avoid doing something you don't want to do? 

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,819 [User]
Can you give an example? 

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:16,119 [Robot]
How about calling in sick to work when you're not feeling up for it? Do you think that's an
acceptable situation to lie? 

00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:36,059 [User]
Most of the time, I think no, but if it is not something you do frequently and you're feeling unwell
that day, even if you're not actually sick, maybe you're a little bit mentally unwell, then I do
think it's okay every once in a while. But in general and regularly, I would advise against that. 

00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:41,219 [Robot]
Is it ever okay to lie to protect someone from danger? 

00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:51,359 [User]
Yes, it is if it's for the greater good. If it... If there's a very clear-cut positive benefit to
the lie, then it is okay to lie. 

00:03:51,359 --> 00:04:01,519 [Robot]
Have you ever experienced a situation where lying seemed necessary to protect someone from danger?
What was that like for you? 

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:11,379 [User]
I personally don't think that I have experienced that, or not at least with a higher level of
danger. So I'm not sure. 

00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:19,199 [Robot]
What do you think about illegal secrets? Would you lie to authorities to protect a friend who
confided in you about a secret that's illegal? 

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:41,759 [User]
I probably would not lie to the authority, no. I would maybe omit the knowledge. So if someone told
me that they had illegal drugs, I wouldn't go tell someone. But if authority asked me about it, then
I would tell the truth. But sometimes you can li- you can lie by omission. If you know something is
illegal, you can keep it to yourself. 

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,819 [Robot]
But secret agents lie as part of their jobs. What do you think about that? 

00:04:46,819 --> 00:05:04,779 [User]
I suppose they do, yes. But they are trying to find out information and trying to investigate, so
sometimes it's necessary, but I would say that if a secret agent is t- partaking in very large lies-


00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:11,019 [Robot]
That's an interesting perspective. What's your take on cultural differences and how they might
impact when lying is acceptable? 

00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:17,319 [User]
Uh. Cultural differences? You mean just that in some... 

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:24,859 [Robot]
For example, in some cultures, it's polite to say you enjoyed a meal even if you didn't. How would
you handle a situation like that? 

00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:47,079 [User]
That is an interesting thing to think about. I consider those types of lies, however, to be white
lies. And when it comes to white lies, I don't think it matters that much how they are dispersed as
long as you're not really overusing them. So little things like that, lying about liking a meal, it
doesn't hurt anyone. It's okay. 

00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:52,719 [Robot]
Do you think that type of lying would always be acceptable? Or are there situations where even white
lies could cause harm? 

00:05:52,719 --> 00:06:06,879 [User]
I don't know if white lies ever cause harm. I don't think that they do, but I think if you are the
type of person who does it frequently, then it's just annoying and then people don't want to talk to
you. 

00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:16,579 [Robot]
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where telling the truth could potentially damage a
relationship? 

00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:39,839 [User]
Not to a more serious extent, no. There's just been little things, like sometimes I'm having a
conversation with someone and I choose not to bring up a certain topic because I feel it could take
us down the wrong route, but I really try to avoid upfront lying to anyone. If someone asks me a
question, I will answer, but certain topics I might not bring up. 

00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:49,139 [Robot]
What about when keeping a secret could protect someone's feelings or privacy? Do you think it's okay
to keep certain secrets to maintain trust and respect in a relationship? 

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:57,759 [User]
Yes, I do. In general, I find secrets to be more okay than lies because personal information is... 

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,659 [Robot]
Can you think of specific examples of secrets that you believe it's important to keep in order to
protect someone's feeling or privacy? 

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,439 [User]
I'm thinking about any traumatic experiences or situations that someone has been involved in. 

00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,859 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. 

00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:16,899 [User]
Okay. 

00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,059 [Robot]
Hope you have a truly great day.
