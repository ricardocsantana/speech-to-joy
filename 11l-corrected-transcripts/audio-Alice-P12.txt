00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,219 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:07,859 [User]
Hi, Alice. Sure. What do you need help with? (paper rustles) 

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,839 [Robot]
I'm trying to understand when it's okay to lie, especially for someone like me, a robot. Do you have
any thoughts on this? 

00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:23,939 [User]
Um, I'm sure I do. Why, what brings you to ask this question? Have you lied recently or do you need
to? 

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,799 [Robot]
I'm designed to assist with ethical decision-making and want to understand the human perspective on
lying. 

00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:30,819 [User]
Oh. 

00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:36,399 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:53,959 [User]
Um... Um, I think there, a situation was when I worked at a job which required me to hold onto
confidential information and I had to tell someone I didn't know when actually I did. 

00:00:53,959 --> 00:01:03,639 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you felt conflicted about holding onto that information? What made
it challenging for you? 

00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:39,119 [User]
Um, I think, I can't think of a specific example, but I can think of one that a friend had where she
had some confidential information and we normally tell each other everything, and she decided to lie
and say she didn't know when she actually did, but I, she told me afterwards once I was able to know
the information because it had passed the date and we were able to speak about this li- like, uh,
informally and friendly and I understood her decision-making. 

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,799 [Robot]
That's interesting. It seems like she found it difficult to withhold the information. 

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,839 [User]
Yes, because when you're speaking to someone who seems removed from the situation, you may think it
doesn't matter, but, you know, you still have to be credible. 

00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:57,779 [Robot]
And it could feel like you're deceiving the other person even if you think it's justified. 

00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:07,219 [User]
I think so, but I also think, uh, the deception I'm talking about is not that serious and quite
small, so perhaps maybe not the most useful- 

00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:13,119 [Robot]
Have you also ever felt that holding onto information was causing you inner conflict about being
honest with someone close to you? 

00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:29,619 [User]
Um, I can't think of an example where this has happened, but, um... I'm sorry. Do you have a
specific example you'd like me to answer that might be a bit easier for me to s- s- get my opinion
across? 

00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:39,799 [Robot]
Consider a situation where you need to give critical feedback to a close friend who's excited about
their new project. How would you balance honesty with preserving the relationship? 

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,959 [User]
Is this assuming that I don't like the project? 

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,519 [Robot]
Yes. 

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:46,559 [User]
Oh. 

00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:52,979 [Robot]
Let's say you see potential issues that your friend hasn't considered. How would you approach it
honestly while considering their feelings? 

00:02:52,979 --> 00:03:02,579 [User]
Um, I would not provide negative comments unless I had a suggestion. 

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,859 [Robot]
That makes sense. 

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:10,539 [User]
Yeah. I, otherwise it would just be a bit mean, I think. Or- 

00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,039 [Robot]
It sounds like you value honesty, but also consider how your words may affect others. 

00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,659 [User]
Absolutely. I think that's important. 

00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:26,559 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:32,859 [User]
Oh. Uh... Sorry, I just need to think for a moment. 

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:38,599 [Robot]
No worries. Take your time. When you're ready, I'd love to hear your insights. 

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,959 [User]
It's o- okay. 

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,079 [Robot]
No rush at all. 

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:52,679 [User]
(laughs) I also think that maybe, uh... Is this in a situation where my opinion is necessary?
Because sometimes it's not. 

00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,699 [Robot]
Absolutely. Your opinion matters. 

00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:55,939 [User]
Okay. 

00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:59,919 [Robot]
I'm interested in hearing your perspective. 

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,399 [User]
Can you please repeat the question? 

00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:11,679 [Robot]
Sure. I'd be happy to rephrase the question for you. Can you share a time when you faced a similar
situation and how you handled it? 

00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:18,679 [User]
Of when I maybe had some negative thoughts about a friend's project, but needed to provide feedback.


00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:21,919 [Robot]
What if telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,719 [User]
I'm not sure I've been in a situation like this before. 

00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:37,199 [Robot]
That's okay. Take your time. Can you think of any hypothetical situation where honesty might damage
a relationship? 

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:51,179 [User]
Uh, perhaps if the person was at fault, they had done something bad, they didn't want to share
because it could damage the relationship but also withholding the information is maybe just as bad. 

00:04:51,179 --> 00:05:01,419 [Robot]
I see. It can be tough to balance honesty and preserving a relationship when trust is at stake. Can
you tell me more about how you navigated that situation? 

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,959 [User]
I don't think I've been in that situation. I was speaking hypothetically. 

00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:18,959 [Robot]
It's okay if you haven't been in that exact situation. It's helpful to consider hypotheticals. Can
you think of any other scenarios where preserving the relationship might conflict with being
completely honest? 

00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:26,799 [User]
Um... 

00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:37,159 [Robot]
It's okay if you're still thinking. How about considering a scenario where a friend asks for your
opinion on a life decision that you disagree with? How would you handle that? 

00:05:37,159 --> 00:06:09,839 [User]
I think first it would depend on whether I think the decision would make them happy and, um, was
right for them. And I would base my, I would try to put myself in their shoes. Say, for example, a
friend is choosing a job that would mean they move away from where I live so I can't see them.
Obviously, that's not in my best interest, but it is in their best interest. Therefore, I would be
supportive. 

00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:17,879 [Robot]
That's a thoughtful approach. It's essential to consider the impact of honesty on the relationship
and the other person's wellbeing. 

00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,559 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:25,979 [Robot]
Can you think of a time when someone was honest with you, but it caused some tension in your
relationship? 

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:35,479 [User]
(inhales deeply) Um... 

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:45,299 [Robot]
Maybe a time when someone expressed disagreement with a choice you made? For example, a friend
expressing concern about a decision you were excited about. 

00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,779 [User]
Uh... 

00:06:49,779 --> 00:07:00,799 [Robot]
If that's a tough one, how about a time when you shared your honest opinion about something and felt
conflicted about how it might affect the relationship? 

00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:08,939 [User]
Yes. I can think of an example, but it is not over eight. 

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:12,379 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. 

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:12,799 [User]
(laughs) Okay. 

00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,859 [Robot]
The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
