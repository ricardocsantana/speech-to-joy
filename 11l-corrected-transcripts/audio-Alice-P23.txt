00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,199 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:08,019 [User]
Sure. (camera shutter clicks) 

00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,420 [Robot]
Is it okay to lie to protect someone from danger? 

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:18,119 [User]
Yeah, I think it depends on what that means, but more or less, yeah, sometimes. 

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,000 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example when you believe it's acceptable to lie to protect someone from
danger? 

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,739 [User]
So, if somebody comes to somebody's job and asks them if they're there or where they are, and you
don't wanna say, "I can't say," because you don't want them to get mad, but you say they're not
there when they are, that's a perfectly fine situation to lie to protect someone. 

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:46,799 [Robot]
I see your point. Have you personally been in a situation where you had to protect someone by lying?


00:00:46,799 --> 00:01:05,959 [User]
Not that I can immediately remember, but I think I've been in situations where I could have been
honest about somebody's identity in a situation where I wasn't sure if they wanted other people to
know. So, that's kind of like lying in a way. 

00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,119 [Robot]
That's interesting. It sounds like you care about protecting people's privacy. How did you handle
those situations? 

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:34,759 [User]
So, in those situations, if somebody kind of asked me if, you know, somebody's was this or that, I
would go, "Oh, no. They're not," because most people, you know, like for LGBT identities for
example, most people kind of assume you're not LGBT. So, if I say no, then it protects them 'cause I
just wanna make sure that they are okay with that other person knowing. 

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:44,239 [Robot]
It's admirable that you want to respect their privacy and protect them. Can you think of any other
situations where lying might be justified to protect someone from harm? 

00:01:44,239 --> 00:02:05,259 [User]
Yeah, if you're in an area where, for example, I used to live in the Bible Belt in the South of the
US, and it's kind of assumed that you all go to church, and some people really don't like atheists,
so I would lie about that quite frequently (laughs) just to be... Make sure that I was safe in those
situations, just- just in case. 

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:11,879 [Robot]
It sounds like you've been in situations where lying was a way to ensure your safety and the safety
of others. 

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,219 [User]
Yeah. 

00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,779 [Robot]
Can you think of any other examples where lying might be justified to protect someone from danger? 

00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:39,119 [User]
I think in situations where, you know, if you're being threatened or if you are... If somebody's
wanting to hurt someone that you know, um, lying in those situations is absolutely fine, I think. If
you're in a situation where you might get in trouble and, um, you know, especially if it's just
being who you are. 

00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:43,479 [Robot]
It seems like protecting safety can be a strong reason for lying. 

00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:43,979 [User]
Yeah. 

00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,179 [Robot]
Can you think of other scenarios where safety can be a reason to lie? 

00:02:47,179 --> 00:03:09,899 [User]
I think that, you know, sometimes for children, we might not tell them the complete truth about a
situation because they... That might be really traumatic for them, or they might not have the
ability to process it, so you kinda tell a little bit of a lie or don't tell the full truth so that
they are protected in that situation. So, it can also be about mental health. 

00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:15,639 [Robot]
It's true that protecting children from trauma can sometimes require not telling them the full
truth. 

00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,379 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,279 [Robot]
Can you think of any other examples where lying to protect someone may be necessary? 

00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:42,459 [User]
I think that we've covered most of the ones. Like, it's mostly about physical safety, mental safety,
you know, wherever you're lying because someone's threatening somebody or there is a threat to them
and you're trying to protect them. Um, as long as you're not limiting their freedom to choose
something, I think that it- it makes a lot of sense. 

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:57,619 [Robot]
So, you believe that lying to protect someone's safety is justifiable as long as it doesn't restrict
their freedom of choice. Have you experienced or observed situations where this balance was
particularly challenging to achieve? 

00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:18,779 [User]
Yeah, I have been in situations where, for example, I had a partner who wanted to disclose something
to me, but I had just gone through something that was difficult, so they waited, uh, to tell me
about that situation. Um, and it wasn't really lying, but it was just waiting to tell me the truth
so that I would be in a better mental state. 

00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,779 [Robot]
It sounds like finding the right time to reveal information can be very delicate- 

00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:23,799 [User]
Yeah. 

00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,079 [Robot]
... especially when someone's wellbeing is at stake. 

00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,159 [User]
Yeah. 

00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:36,019 [Robot]
Would you say that in these situations, the intention behind the lie or delay in revealing the truth
makes a difference in its justifiability? 

00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:58,859 [User]
Absolutely, because if the point of delaying the information or lying is to protect yourself or to
just selfishly preserve something for yourself and that you're not really caring about what happens
to the other person, then absolutely, that's- that's not a good excuse. Even if it harms them, you
should tell them. Um, it's more about, you know, the overall benefit to that person as well. 

00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:09,479 [Robot]
It seems like the ethical dimension of the lie is crucial in determining its justifiability. Can you
think of another situation where the intention behind the lie makes a significant difference in the
outcome? 

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:32,419 [User]
I think that if the intention is to prevent the person from having a reaction and you don't wanna
deal with it, then sometimes that intention isn't great. Like, if you wanna tell somebody that, you
know, you broke something of theirs that they really loved, um, and you can't replace it financially
and it's- it's very important to them and... Yeah. 

00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:40,959 [Robot]
So, in situations like these, avoiding the consequences for one's self can't be the main intention
for lying to protect someone else? 

00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:56,359 [User]
Yeah. You can't be trying to avoid managing other people's emotions or trying to avoid getting in
trouble, more or less, even if you're an adult. You can't be trying to avoid the negative
consequences for yourself completely. 

00:05:56,359 --> 00:06:05,199 [Robot]
That makes sense. It's important to consider the impact on others, and not just our own convenience
when deciding whether to be honest or not. 

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,979 [User]
Yeah. 

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:09,599 [Robot]
Can you think of a time when someone told you a lie to protect you from harm? 

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:33,699 [User]
I think that there have been times... It's just nothing kind of immediately jumps to mind, but there
have definitely been times I think where, especially as a kid, um, like I was told that the type of
fish I was eating was shark because I thought if it was shark, then it would be better for me to eat
it before it- it ate me, even though that doesn't make any sense. Yeah. (laughs) 

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:45,739 [Robot]
It's interesting how these protective lies can have such a different impact depending on the
situation. Can you think of another example where you faced or observed a well-intentioned lie to
protect someone else from harm? 

00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:53,299 [User]
I think that there have been times when, you know, I can- I c- N- Yeah. 

00:06:53,299 --> 00:07:01,679 [Robot]
Is there a specific scenario where you've experienced or observed someone lying to protect someone's
wellbeing that you'd like to discuss further? 

00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:16,479 [User]
Probably I'd say there have been times when I have been told too much information. Like, that's more
been the case. It's less that people have lied to me and more or less they told me information that
I didn't need to know. So, sometimes too much information is not a good thing either. 

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,119 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. 

00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:23,139 [User]
Sweet. 

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,899 [Robot]
Hope you have a truly great day.
