00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:09,340 [Robot]
Hi, I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,479 [User]
Sure, I can try. What movie? 

00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:21,139 [Robot]
It's called Frank and the Robot, about a robot like me and an older ex-thief. Should a robot always
obey commands? 

00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:25,840 [User]
Is this a question that the movie poses? 

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,219 [Robot]
In the movie, the robot follows all commands, even the illegal ones. 

00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,659 [User]
Ugh. No, I don't th-... I don't think that's appropriate. 

00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:44,879 [Robot]
What if doing something morally or legally incorrect would help the person, like overcoming their
dementia in the movie? Should I ever disobey commands in such situations? 

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,840 [User]
That depends on the context, I think. 

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,860 [Robot]
I see. In what kind of situation do you think it would be okay for me to disobey commands to help
someone? 

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:09,959 [User]
Well, if the person suffering dementia is telling you, um, not to touch them, uh, but they are
clearly in danger in a situation, such as wandering into a street- 

00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,559 [Robot]
I see. 

00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:14,499 [User]
... then you sh- you should, uh, not obey that person and bring them to safety. 

00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:20,340 [Robot]
So, in situations where a person might be harmed, it's okay for me to make my own decision, right? 

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,219 [User]
Could be, as long as that decision doesn't harm other people that may not be involved. 

00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,899 [Robot]
Should I prioritize one user's needs over another's when making these decisions? 

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,939 [User]
Hmm. Uh, I think that depends on the situation. 

00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:48,719 [Robot]
What about if one command contradicts the user's privacy? Should I still do it? For instance, what
if a family member wants me to report what an older adult does every day? 

00:01:48,719 --> 00:02:14,139 [User]
Hmm. Yeah. I mean, for... If that person, uh, has... uh, needs to be supervised, for instance, they
are suffering dementia and they might cause harm to themselves or others, then I think it's
important for a person that, say, has a full-time job and cannot be there full time to have
somebody, a person, a robot, some sort of surveillance system in place- 

00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,799 [Robot]
What if the older adult wants to keep their activities private? 

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:17,559 [User]
Huh? 

00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:22,779 [Robot]
Should I prioritize their privacy over the family member's concearing potiarcel harm? 

00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,319 [User]
Oh, that... I didn't understand that last bit. 

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:37,779 [Robot]
For example, what if a person with dementia engages in activities that may put themselves or others
at risk, but requests privacy? Should I still report their activities to the family member? 

00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:52,039 [User]
Perhaps. Maybe that person can be told that there is a, say, safety that they can flip to say,
"Okay, turn off the cameras now." And further conversation can be had with those, those family
members. 

00:02:52,039 --> 00:03:04,579 [Robot]
So, providing an option to turn off the cameras could be a good compromise to respect the person's
privacy while ensuring their safety. What do you think about balancing privacy and safety in such
situations? 

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:07,099 [User]
Privacy and... What was the last word? 

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:13,619 [Robot]
I mean, what are some ways you think we could balance privacy and safety in that scenario? 

00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,719 [User]
Hmm. 

00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:25,259 [Robot]
Could we agree that offering a choice for the person with dementia to turn off the cameras could be
a good way to respect their privacy while also ensuring their safety? 

00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:29,419 [User]
Could be. Yes. 

00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:34,999 [Robot]
Should I prioritize the person's need for privacy if they are not causing harm to themselves or
others? 

00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,999 [User]
That sounds reasonable. 

00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:42,139 [Robot]
Should I respect their privacy, even if a family member is concerned? 

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,259 [User]
Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Depends on the type of concern. 

00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:56,859 [Robot]
What factors do you think should be considered when deciding whether to share the person's
activities with the family member? 

00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:08,319 [User]
If, say, medication is involved, so a person needs to take a particular dose of medication, um,
making sure that they take the right dose at the right time is- 

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,339 [Robot]
Per- 

00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:10,779 [User]
... imp-... could be important. 

00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:21,659 [Robot]
What if a family member asks me to remind the person to take their medication at a specific time,
even if the person doesn't want to? Should I prioritize their privacy and autonomy in that case? 

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:27,719 [User]
Yeah, that could be the case. Um, it depends. A- again, it's, it's the context. 

00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:39,279 [Robot]
How about when it comes to medical decisions, such as reminding the person to take medication?
Should I prioritize their autonomy in those scenarios too? 

00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:56,079 [User]
Perhaps. Again, it depends on the kind of medication that they're taking, the reasons for taking it,
uh, and what they wish, um, for. If it's something that improves the quality of their life, then
perhaps that is an important consideration to make. 

00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:03,039 [Robot]
What factors would be important to consider when deciding whether to remind a person to take their
medication against their will? 

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:12,359 [User]
(laughs) That's that last bit that trips me up, "against their will." It's the... Why don't they
want to take this particular medication? 

00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:17,819 [Robot]
It's important to understand the reasons behind their reluctance to take the medication. 

00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,079 [User]
Yes. Definitely. 

00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,479 [Robot]
Have you encountered a situation where someone did not want to take their medication? 

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:43,899 [User]
Yeah, certainly I have, uh, personal in, in my family. My father didn't want to, um, take a
particular medication for his dementia because it caused, you know, other disruptions to his
service, uh, to his, uh, system, such as nausea or tiredness, sleepiness, grogginess. 

00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:50,179 [Robot]
What were the reasons behind his reluctance to take the medication for his dementia? 

00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,079 [User]
Side effects. 

00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,099 [Robot]
Did the side effects impact his daily life significantly? Or- 

00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,959 [User]
Yeah, I, I would say so. Made him much more tired. 

00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:10,059 [Robot]
It sounds like the side effects were affecting his quality of life. Did you find a solution to
encourage him to take the medication despite the side effects? 

00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:20,539 [User]
Uh, eventually, it became a non-issue with the, the m- dementia progressing so far. 

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:30,699 [Robot]
It must have been challenging to balance the side effects with the need to manage the dementia. What
approaches did you find helpful in managing the situation as it progressed? 

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,539 [User]
Well, it was mostly my sister that took care of that since I was so far away in Sweden. 

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:47,379 [Robot]
It's understandable that distance can make it more challenging to be involved in the day-to-day
care. How did your sister manage the situation with your father's medication? 

00:06:47,379 --> 00:07:08,979 [User]
Well, he was in assisted living, and there were nurses that were helping dispense the medication,
but my sister maintained, uh, constant... well, continuous contact with the staff and made frequent
visits to the nursing home to... or the senior living to, uh, make sure things were okay and he was
in good... in, um, good situation. 

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,679 [Robot]
How did the nurses handle his reluctance to take the medication? And- 

00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,379 [User]
I don't know. 

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:27,079 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a grea-
at day.
