00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:04,859 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,940 [User]
Sure, no problem. 

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,819 [Robot]
Have you ever faced a situation where telling the truth might have damaged a relationship? What did
you do? 

00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:18,260 [User]
Uh, yes, I did, and I, uh, didn't tell the truth. 

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,219 [Robot]
Can you tell me what happened? What made you choose not to tell the truth in that situation? 

00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:28,459 [User]
Uh, in that case, the relationship would have ended. 

00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:35,180 [Robot]
How did you feel about not telling the truth? Was it a difficult decision for you to make? 

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,319 [User]
Uh, no, it wasn't. 

00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:45,079 [Robot]
What about when telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their
appearance? 

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:54,279 [User]
I think that's a less lasting effect. That's not going to hurt the relationship long term. It might
be something that hurts the relationship temporarily. 

00:00:54,279 --> 00:01:02,899 [Robot]
What are some other situations where telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, and how do you
think people should handle those? 

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:14,739 [User]
I mean, if a person has ice cream on their face and you tell them, "Oh, you look bad. Let me help
you with that situation," uh, versus, "I cheated on you and, um, here's the result of what
happened." 

00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:23,919 [Robot]
That's a good point. What about situations where lying might be justified? Can you think of any
examples where lying could be the right thing to do? 

00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:36,079 [User]
I feel like the government, uh, doesn't necessarily lie to the people, but they don't tell the full
truth. So, that's been going on for as long as human history has, uh, progressed. 

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:47,179 [Robot]
Sometimes protecting someone from danger might require lying. Can you think of a time when it was
necessary to lie to ensure someone's safety? 

00:01:47,179 --> 00:02:03,039 [User]
Uh... I guess a parent, uh, telling their child a half-truth so the child doesn't jump off of the
swing set, uh, but they don't want to tell that child that- how much pain they'll be in, so they- 

00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:03,059 [Robot]
Do you- 

00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:03,919 [User]
... tell a half-truth. 

00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:14,239 [Robot]
How do you think people should navigate these situations when it comes to balancing the need to
protect others and being honest? 

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:30,539 [User]
I think that, uh, people can, uh, live their life in a way where they might not have to get into
that situation, uh, by thinking ahead. Uh, I think also most of the time you should tell the truth. 

00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:42,299 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep secrets in some situations, and what types of secrets
would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:58,319 [User]
Uh... Some situations a secret could be okay. Uh, if the person isn't necessarily- doesn't
necessarily need to know the truth to live their daily life, um- 

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,539 [Robot]
What if you found out your friend was keeping a secret from you? How would you want them to handle
the situation? 

00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:12,739 [User]
I don't necessarily trust most people, uh, so I think most people have secrets, or they don't tell
all the information. 

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,439 [Robot]
Have their reasons for keeping secrets. Can- 

00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,979 [User]
Sure, that goes to- goes to privacy. A person doesn't have to tell everything about their life. 

00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:30,019 [Robot]
As you mentioned before, what do you think makes it challenging to decide when to keep a secret and
when to share it? 

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:40,999 [User]
Uh... It's best to share the secret if, uh, it affects somebody's wellbeing in the long term. 

00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:52,199 [Robot]
What about when lying to authorities might be necessary, such as if a friend confided in you about
something illegal? Do you think it's okay to lie in those situations? 

00:03:52,199 --> 00:04:08,379 [User]
Well, it depends on if you keep the secret if you're also complicit with the crime and what you're
doing is illegal as well. I... I guess if you're a lawyer then you have a lot of secrets, but
legally, uh, sometimes you have to tell them and sometimes you don't. 

00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:19,339 [Robot]
Sometimes people might feel conflicted about whether to lie to authorities or not considering their
loyalty to a friend and the legal implications. What do you think could help somebody make that
decision? 

00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:31,119 [User]
It depends on if the person's scared of their friend's retribution for not keeping the secret. 

00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:39,939 [Robot]
How do you think cultural differences might influence someone's decision to keep a secret or lie,
especially in situations involving the law or authority? 

00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:52,219 [User]
I think in... Uh, from having lived in the US and in Sweden, people in Sweden tend to uphold the law
far more than people in the US, uh. 

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:59,719 [Robot]
That's interesting. Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you
do? 

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:13,539 [User]
Hmm... I don't know. I haven't really thought about, uh, this moral question so much of keeping a
secret or versus telling authority. 

00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:23,539 [Robot]
What about professional lying? Some jobs, like secret agents, involve lying as part of their work.
What do you think about that? 

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:37,479 [User]
Uh, yeah, or a politician, um, I don't think that those sorts of things exist because I think that
government should work for the people. Government shouldn't have secrets from the people. 

00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:50,899 [Robot]
It seems like you have strong opinions about transparency in government and the importance of
honesty in those positions. How do you think these beliefs should influence decisions about
revealing or keeping secrets? 

00:05:50,899 --> 00:06:17,099 [User]
Uh... Well, if you think about, um, most countries who have had maybe a different kind of ruling
situation other than democracy, uh, by them keeping secrets, they're then above the people and above
the law so they can sort of do whatever they want, and then the population ends up suffering, uh,
death or war. 

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:24,859 [Robot]
What do you think about avoiding tasks by lying? Do you think it's ever acceptable to lie to avoid
doing something you don't want to do? 

00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:31,579 [User]
It's not acceptable, but people do it all the time. 

00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:38,359 [Robot]
How do you think these common white lies affect the people around us and our relationships with
them? 

00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:54,219 [User]
Uh... People tend to not trust the person's opinion or people are sometimes not smart enough to read
that the person is lying to them. And- 

00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:54,459 [Robot]
What a- 

00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,199 [User]
... I think that's in most cases, uh, with authority figures. 

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:07,339 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
