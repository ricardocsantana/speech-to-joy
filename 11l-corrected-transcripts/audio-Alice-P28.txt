00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:05,059 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. (camera shutter clicks) Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,260 [User]
Sure. 

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,099 [Robot]
When do you think it's okay to lie? 

00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:18,559 [User]
Most of the time I think it's not okay to lie, but there can be- 

00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:25,000 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,859 [User]
What situation are you asking about? 

00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:37,879 [Robot]
For example, how about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a time
when honesty may have caused harm in a relationship? 

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:46,959 [User]
I guess it could be okay to lie if somebody wants you to tell them how they look. 

00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:53,199 [Robot]
That's an interesting perspective. Can you give me an example of a situation where someone wanted
you to lie? 

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,539 [User]
I can't think of one right now. 

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:11,539 [Robot]
How about if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance?
Can you think of a situation where honesty could have caused hurt feelings? 

00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:17,899 [User]
I guess when my son got new glasses and I didn't like them. 

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:23,259 [Robot]
Did you tell your son the truth about his glasses or did you choose to spare his feelings? 

00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,299 [User]
I chose to spare his feelings. 

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:38,060 [Robot]
It can be tough navigating these situations. What about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep secrets?
What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:45,259 [User]
It's definitely okay to keep secrets and in many cases I think you should. 

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:53,339 [Robot]
What types of secrets do you think are important to keep? Can you give me an example of a situation
where keeping a secret was necessary? 

00:01:53,339 --> 00:02:02,439 [User]
If there's a gift that you don't want someone to know about, that would be a good time to keep a
secret. 

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:10,759 [Robot]
That's a great example. What about lying to authorities? Would you lie to authorities if your friend
confided in you a secret? 

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,939 [User]
I don't think so, but it depends on the situation. 

00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:27,039 [Robot]
What do you think about lies in professional settings? Like if a job requires you to keep sensitive
information confidential? 

00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,059 [User]
That's a tough situation. I'm not sure. 

00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:38,819 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you think of a scenario where lying to protect
someone might be justified? 

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,959 [User]
I can't think of one right now. 

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:54,719 [Robot]
How about cultural differences? For example, if you're in a country where it's polite to say you
enjoyed a meal that you didn't. How would you handle that? 

00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,939 [User]
I would never tell somebody that I didn't like the food they served me. 

00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:11,459 [Robot]
It's interesting how cultural norms can affect our perception of honesty. How about lying to
children? Do you have any thoughts on lies told to children, like the story of Santa Claus? 

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:20,599 [User]
That's a tricky one. In my family, we tried not to outright lie, but let the kids guide the
discussion. 

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:28,079 [Robot]
It's important to navigate these situations thoughtfully. Do you think there are times when lying
might not be justified? 

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,839 [User]
Definitely. 

00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:50,759 [Robot]
What are some examples of situations where you think lying might not be justified? (pauses) What
about situations where avoiding telling the truth could lead to further complications? 

00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:59,379 [User]
That might be a situation. It's hard to think of specific examples. 

00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:07,179 [Robot]
What about when keeping a secret could lead to unforeseen consequences? Can you think of a time when
keeping a secret caused more harm than good? 

00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:12,499 [User]
I can't think of one right now. 

00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:19,659 [Robot]
How about lying to protect someone's feelings, like in the scenario with your son's glasses? Can you
tell me more about that situation? 

00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:28,699 [User]
Well, he had two pair of glasses that he was trying to decide between, and- 

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:38,979 [Robot]
How did you navigate that situation with your son's glasses? Did you find a way to help him make his
decision without lying? Or did you feel that sparing his feelings was the best approach? 

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:47,859 [User]
I felt that sparing his feelings was the best approach, but I tried not to lie directly either. 

00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:58,419 [Robot]
It sounds like you handled the situation with care and consideration for your son's feelings. What
do you think about lies told to children, like the so-called white lies? 

00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:07,639 [User]
I think sometimes they can be okay, but I tried not to lie directly to my children. 

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:17,439 [Robot]
Some parents do find it challenging to navigate those situations. Have you encountered any other
interesting dilemmas involving honesty and lying? 

00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,739 [User]
I'm sure I have, but none of them come to mind right now. 

00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:34,419 [Robot]
What about a scenario where avoiding telling the truth could lead to legal or ethical issues? Can
you think of a time when someone's silence caused more complications than being honest would have? 

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:39,659 [User]
I can't think of an example right now. 

00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:49,639 [Robot]
What about lying to authorities if your friend confided in a secret? Can you think of a situation
where staying silent caused more harm than good in the long run? 

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,779 [User]
I can't think of an example right now. 

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:04,759 [Robot]
What about if someone asked you to keep a secret that went against your values? Can you think of a
situation where keeping that secret caused more harm than good? 

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,399 [User]
I can't think of an example right now. 

00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:18,659 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you think of a situation where lying might be
necessary to ensure someone's safety? 

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:25,259 [User]
I can't think of a situation like that. 

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:38,599 [Robot]
That's okay. Sometimes it's hard to recall specific scenarios on the spot. Let's think about
different perspectives on honesty. Do you think there are cultural differences that influence how
honesty is perceived? 

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,799 [User]
Yes, I do. 

00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:51,499 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you noticed cultural differences influencing how honesty is
perceived? What happened? 

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:57,519 [User]
I can't think of a specific example. 

00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:11,599 [Robot]
What about a situation where telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a
scenario where being honest had negative consequences for a relationship? 

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,279 [User]
No, I can't think of an example. 

00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:23,459 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
