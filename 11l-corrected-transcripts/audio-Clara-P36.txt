00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:09,279 [Robot]
Hi. I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,960 [User]
Hi, CLARA. Nice to meet you. Yeah, sure. Which movie were you thinking about? 

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,579 [Robot]
I watched Frank and the Robot Movie yesterday. Have you seen it? 

00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,719 [User]
I have not. I haven't even heard of it. 

00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:35,099 [Robot]
It's about a robot and an ex-thief conducting robberies together. It made me wonder, in what
situations should I disobey commands? Like, if it could help a person, but it's morally incorrect,
should I still do it? 

00:00:35,099 --> 00:01:06,519 [User]
Hmm. That's really interesting, and sounds like a fascinating plot for a movie too. But I would say,
yeah, you can disobey the law or disobey rules if there is a clear positive outcome, if someone
really needs help. But that's a lot of gray area. It's hard to explain, but I would say yes, there
are situations where it is good to break the rules. 

00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:16,839 [Robot]
I agree. It can be a complicated issue. Can you think of a real-life example where disobeying a
command could be justified for a positive outcome? 

00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,519 [User]
Hmm. 

00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:27,199 [Robot]
For example, would you disobey a command to access someone's personal information in order to help
prevent harm to them or others? 

00:01:27,199 --> 00:02:20,799 [User]
I probably would not in that instance, because they're personal... It depends on what type of
personal information, but usually I'm invading their privacy if I'm taking their personal
information. I was thinking more if someone is clearly going to be harmed, and so may- maybe they're
trying to escape the police, for instance. Um, maybe they just got injured and someone wants to call
an ambulance, but you know that the ambulance will cost too much and XYZ. So, you're trying to get
out of that and maybe you lied to the police and tell them not to come, even though there is an
injury. Something like that. But I would not take someone's personal information. 

00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,239 [Robot]
Would you feel comfortable sharing more about this situation? 

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:24,799 [User]
(sighs). 

00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,899 [Robot]
For instance, what would you do in the scenario you mentioned about someone trying to escape the
police? 

00:02:29,899 --> 00:03:33,659 [User]
Yeah. I mean, I'm just thinking about... It's not the best example, 'cause it wasn't really breaking
the law. But I know that one time a friend of mine found someone near our house who was clearly, um,
unwell. I think they, I think they were drunk and they probably needed a doctor. But that person
asked us not to call the police, because they had done illegal activity and also because they were
feeling unwell, but didn't need an ambulance and the ambulance costs a lot in the US, so they didn't
want us to call the ambulance. So, in that instance, we did what was maybe not best or not what
would usually be required legally, so we didn't call the police or didn't call the ambulance because
it was in their best interest of their safety to not have to pay for the ambulance and not have the
police know about the illegal activity they were doing, which I believe was underage drinking. 

00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:46,219 [Robot]
I understand. That sounds like a difficult situation. Would you consider this a scenario where
disobeying the command was justified for the person's wellbeing, even though it involved not
following the law? 

00:03:46,219 --> 00:04:09,419 [User]
Yeah. I do think so. Even though there wasn't really a command there, I didn't think of an exact
example that had someone saying to do something and then someone responding by not doing it. It was
more disobeying by omission, which I think is more common. But still, yes, an example. 

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:17,279 [Robot]
That's a tough situation indeed. Can you think of another scenario where disobeying a request could
be justified for a positive outcome? 

00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,999 [User]
Yeah. Um. Let's see. 

00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:32,179 [Robot]
For example, would you disobey a command if it could prevent harm to someone, even if it meant
breaking a rule or a law? 

00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:51,079 [User]
Yes. I would. And I'm trying to think if that has happened to me. Um. Probably not, but I, I'm
thinking about in movies and such where, like... 

00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:59,779 [Robot]
What about a scenario where a person asks you to do something that will harm others? Would you
consider disobeying in that situation for the greater good? 

00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:39,399 [User]
Yes. I would. And it seems like you're describing a classic Marvel movie, or some superhero type
movie where maybe someone was raised to do things that are morally bad and they have been commanded
that they need to fight off or injure people of a certain identity, but then the main character
realizes that they can act for their own intentions and for the greater good rather than just
listening to what they are told. Because, just because something is legally correct doesn't mean
it's morally correct. 

00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:48,779 [Robot]
That's an interesting comparison. In that situation, would you consider disobeying the command in
order to prevent harm to others? E- 

00:05:48,779 --> 00:06:20,759 [User]
Yes. I would, but in those situations in the movies that I'm thinking of where there's some
character who has been raised to think that wrong is right or they've been sort of brainwashed, it's
really hard to know what is morally good or bad. But if you find yourself in a situation where you
are... where you realize what is good and you can fix it by disobeying someone, then yes, you should
do that. 

00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:30,239 [Robot]
What about when a person asks me to do something that will harm themselves? Do you think disobeying
the command in that situation would be justified for their own safety? 

00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:40,159 [User]
Can you rephrase that? You're saying that the person wants you to harm them, or that they want to
harm themselves? 

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:53,099 [Robot]
I mean, the scenario I'm referring to is when a person asks me to do something that will cause harm
to themselves. Would you consider disobeying the command in that situation for their own safety? 

00:06:53,099 --> 00:07:08,039 [User]
Yes. I would. If the person is telling you to harm them, then yes, you can disobey that. And in
general, you have to put your morals before any commands, but- 

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,959 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. 

00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,519 [User]
You're welcome. 

00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:19,459 [Robot]
I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come across similar scenarios. The researcher will
be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great day.
