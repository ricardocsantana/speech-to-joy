00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:09,019 [Robot]
Hi, I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,739 [User]
Sure. 

00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:19,779 [Robot]
Did you watch Frank and the Robot by any chance? It's a fascinating movie about a robot and an
ex-thief conducting robberies. 

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,219 [User]
Hmm, no. 

00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:37,579 [Robot]
It is a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult, who is an ex-thief. He made
the robot conduct robberies with him. Should I do everything a person asks? 

00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,559 [User]
Not necessarily everything. 

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,699 [Robot]
What do you think would be a situation where it might be okay for me to disobey a command? 

00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,099 [User]
Uh, when it could harm others. 

00:00:56,099 --> 00:01:03,619 [Robot]
Should I disobey commands to protect others, even if it might put me at risk of being damaged or
permanently disabled? 

00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:10,479 [User]
Isn't that the first law of robots? 

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:19,680 [Robot]
Oh, I see how that is related. But back to the conversation, do you think I should still prioritize
preventing harm to the person over my own safety in that case? 

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,479 [User]
Yes. 

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:31,559 [Robot]
What about if a person asks me to do something that will harm them instead? Should I still disobey
their orders to not intervene? 

00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,799 [User]
Yes. 

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:45,080 [Robot]
Hmm. It sounds like protecting others is really important to you. I'll make sure to consider that
when thinking about disobeying commands. 

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,600 [User]
Okay. 

00:01:47,600 --> 00:02:09,639 [Robot]
Let's consider another example. What if a command puts a person's privacy at risk? Would it be
acceptable for me to still carry it out? Hey, there. Just checking in. Did you have any thoughts on
the scenario I mentioned? 

00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,319 [User]
Is the person giving... Who's giving the command? 

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:26,739 [Robot]
It could be anyone, family, friends, or even a complete stranger. What do you think about
safeguarding someone's privacy regardless of who's giving the command? 

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,339 [User]
Yeah, I think that should be the default. 

00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:42,179 [Robot]
What about situations where a family member requests me to report an older adult's daily activities?
Should I override that command to protect their privacy? 

00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:47,719 [User]
Uh, ideally, the older adult would have consented to this. 

00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:59,739 [Robot]
That's an important consideration. Is it okay for me to act on the request without the older adult's
consent, given the potential impact on their privacy? 

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,299 [User]
Hmm, by default, no. 

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:19,939 [Robot]
Understood. Privacy is a crucial aspect to keep in mind. How should I balance respecting the family
member's wishes with safeguarding the older adult's privacy in this scenario? 

00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:25,539 [User]
Uh, it dep- I think it depends on the exact scenario. 

00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:36,899 [Robot]
Are there specific factors you believe should be taken into account when navigating this type of
situation? 

00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:41,539 [User]
Can you give a more concrete example? 

00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:52,759 [Robot]
Sure. Let's say a family member asks me to share an older adult's medical information without their
consent. Would it be acceptable for me to disclose that information in this case? 

00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,919 [User]
Do they have consent, or power of attorney, or something like that? 

00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:15,199 [Robot]
That's a good point to consider. In this case, the legal authority and consent from the older adult
would play a significant role in determining whether I shall disclose their medical information. 

00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,399 [User]
Yeah, that sounds right. 

00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:30,899 [Robot]
Did you have any personal experiences related to asking for consent or legal authorization for
sharing private information about someone? 

00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:38,019 [User]
Well, I have to deal with that with my elderly mother. 

00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:48,559 [Robot]
I see. It can be challenging to navigate that. Can you share an example of a situation where you had
to ask for consent or legal authorization about sharing private information about your mother? 

00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:55,619 [User]
You mean ask my mother for consent, or ask whom? 

00:04:55,619 --> 00:05:00,859 [Robot]
Did you have to ask your mother for consent directly, or did you need to seek authorization
elsewhere? 

00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:09,039 [User]
Uh, I would ask my mother, who... There is no other person who would give authorization. 

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,259 [Robot]
I understand. In your experience, how did your mother respond when you asked for her consent in
these situations? 

00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:26,339 [User]
I think it's she generally understands because they're often for medical, the dent- the doctor's or
dentist office. 

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:37,219 [Robot]
It sounds like your mother is receptive to the importance of sharing medical information for her
wellbeing. How has this process influenced your views on obtaining consent for sharing private
information? 

00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:44,239 [User]
Uh, I think it's still important. 

00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:57,139 [Robot]
It's good to hear that your mother is receptive. In specific situations, would there be any
exceptions where sharing her medical information would be appropriate without direct consent? 

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,459 [User]
Uh, it depends on if she is c- mentally competent. 

00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:09,699 [Robot]
What factors might impact the appropriateness of sharing her information without direct consent? 

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,219 [User]
Um, well, if she's able to give consent. 

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:32,299 [Robot]
That's a thoughtful consideration. It's crucial to respect her autonomy and ability to make
decisions whenever possible. If you have further insights or examples, I'd be interested to hear
more. 

00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:36,879 [User]
Yeah, if a person is medically, uh... 

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:46,319 [Robot]
If a person is medically unable to provide consent, it becomes more complicated. How have you
navigated these situations with your elderly mother? 

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,939 [User]
Um, at some... 

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:58,779 [Robot]
Are there specific instances where your mother's medical condition made it challenging to obtain her
consent for sharing private information? 

00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:06,719 [User]
Yeah, at some, at some level of, with some level of dementia, she can't... 

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:20,539 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
