00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,019 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,619 [User]
Sure, Alice. 

00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:16,559 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where telling the truth could have hurt someone's feelings? 

00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,239 [User]
Y- Yeah. (laughs) 

00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,699 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:37,860 [User]
There are so many different circumstances that that could happen with, but I think one that comes to
mind is when someone has... 

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,739 [Robot]
What kind of feelings were at risk, and how did you handle it? 

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,680 [User]
(lip smacks) Feelings for me or feelings for the other person? 

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,659 [Robot]
Let's talk about times when telling the truth might hurt someone else's feelings. What kind of
feelings were at risk? How did you handle it? 

00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:02,679 [User]
(lip smacks) Feelings for the other person of possibly being sad. 

00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:08,440 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when telling the truth could have hurt someone's feelings? What did you
do? 

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:16,440 [User]
If someone played a concert and they... 

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,139 [Robot]
How did you navigate the situation? 

00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:35,819 [User]
I said, "Great job," and, "I know you worked really hard on that," and tried to be as positive and
encouraging as possible even if it was not what they wanted. 

00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,319 [Robot]
That's thoughtful of you. What were the consequences of your response? 

00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:48,679 [User]
That we both knew that they could've done better, but it's a... 

00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,599 [Robot]
How did the person react to your response? 

00:01:50,599 --> 00:02:01,219 [User]
They were appreciative and seemed to need comfort, and so were happy that I was being kind. 

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:20,299 [Robot]
It sounds like you handled the situation with empathy and kindness. It's important to consider the
impact of our words on others, even when telling the truth. Can you tell me about a time when
someone lied to you to protect your feelings? 

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,699 [User]
Uh, when I... 

00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,259 [Robot]
Did you ever find out that the person had lied to protect your feelings? 

00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,079 [User]
Yes. 

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:35,299 [Robot]
How did you feel when you found out the truth? 

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:38,819 [User]
Angry and sad. 

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:46,239 [Robot]
It can be tough to find out the truth was hidden from you. Have you been able to move past those
feelings? 

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,919 [User]
Sometimes, but there's always the reminder that I wasn't, um... 

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,699 [Robot]
Have you been able to rebuild trust and maintain the relationship since then? 

00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:00,139 [User]
Usually. 

00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,019 [Robot]
What did you find helpful in rebuilding trust in that relationship? 

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:12,039 [User]
Establishing that honesty was important above projected... 

00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:37,159 [Robot]
It's great to hear that you were able to emphasize honesty in rebuilding the relationship. Trust is
an important foundation in any relationship. Did you find that establishing the importance of
honesty helped you both to communicate more openly and avoid similar situations in the future? 

00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,019 [User]
Sometimes. That's the goal. (laughs) 

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,059 [Robot]
Can you think of other situations where emphasizing honesty helped improve your relationships or
resolve conflicts? 

00:03:49,059 --> 00:04:05,000 [User]
Yeah, it's much easier to trust a person fully when they are being open, even when it's not the most
kind. 

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000 [Robot]
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where someone lied to you and it had a positive impact
on the relationship or helped protect your feelings in some way? 

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000 [User]
I can't think of an instance like that at the moment. 

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:35,279 [Robot]
Got it. What about a situation where lying might be justified, like to protect someone from danger?
Can you think of any examples where that could be necessary? 

00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:43,939 [User]
Uh, necessary, maybe not. 

00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:59,739 [Robot]
For instance, imagine if someone close to you was in danger, but you couldn't disclose it without
putting them at even greater risk. What would you do in that case? 

00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:06,239 [User]
Try to convince them not to be in that circumstance. 

00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:20,899 [Robot]
That's a thoughtful approach. It's important to consider all the options and their potential impact
on the person's safety. Can you think of any other scenarios where lying to protect someone might be
justified? 

00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:37,119 [User]
Especially when dealing with small children, I don't know that lying is quite what I would call it,
but giving them a version of the truth that works for their understanding of the world and language.


00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:52,679 [Robot]
Right, sometimes it's about finding a balance between protecting and preparing them for the world,
isn't it? How do you navigate when to share the full truth with children and when to tailor it to
their understanding? 

00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:58,199 [User]
Yep. 

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:08,839 [Robot]
Do you think it's important for children to eventually learn the complete truth as they grow older,
or do you think some truths are better left unsaid permanently? 

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:16,579 [User]
I think if it's a truth about a... 

00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:48,119 [Robot]
Absolutely, finding the right approach to sharing the truth with children can be challenging but
crucial for their understanding and development. It's always tough finding that balance. How about
situations where lying could be justified? Can you think of any? 

00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:51,279 [User]
If... 

00:06:51,279 --> 00:07:01,099 [Robot]
Can you tell me a bit more about a specific situation where lying might be justified? What was your
thought process in that scenario? 

00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:16,979 [User]
If I am going somewhere where I know other people might be in competition and I need to protect
myself, I might not say, "I'm going to be there." I would leave that out, which could be a lie of
omission. 

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:27,679 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
