00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,339 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,319 [User]
Yes. 

00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:21,699 [Robot]
Do you have any personal experiences with lying that you'd like to share, maybe a time when you were
faced with a difficult situation and had to decide whether to tell the truth or not? 

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,139 [User]
Yes, many experiences. 

00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:31,579 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:54,779 [User]
Sure. W- when I was, I think, 12 years old, my brother and I accidentally lit a fire in the backyard
that scorched, uh, part of a fence. Um, we did not tell our parents. We lied about it, and, uh, we
went away on vacation. And when we came back, my parents discovered the burned fence and, um, and,
uh... 

00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:58,000 [Robot]
What was going through your mind when you decided to lie about the fire? 

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,139 [User]
Uh, that we did not want to be caught. 

00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:08,019 [Robot]
Were you trying to avoid getting into trouble, or were there other reasons behind your decision to
lie? 

00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:13,079 [User]
I think it was just to avoid getting in trouble. 

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:23,179 [Robot]
I understand. It's natural to want to avoid getting into trouble. Do you think there are situations
where it's justified to lie, like to protect someone from getting into trouble? 

00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:26,779 [User]
Oh, yes. Absolutely. 

00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:32,459 [Robot]
Can you give me an example of a situation where you think lying to protect someone is justified? 

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:41,220 [User]
Uh, when telling a truth would do more harm, uh, to more people. 

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:50,720 [Robot]
That's a good point. Lying to protect someone from harm can be a tough decision. Do you think there
are other situations where lying would be justified for protection? 

00:01:50,720 --> 00:02:01,539 [User]
Absolutely. Sometimes people have, uh, personal traits, characteristics that they don't want to
share with other people, and it's necessary to lie to protect their privacy. 

00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:13,319 [Robot]
I see what you mean. It's important to respect people's privacy and personal boundaries. Can you
think of specific examples where lying to protect someone's privacy might be necessary? 

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,719 [User]
Uh, when a person's protected characteristics could endanger them. 

00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:32,419 [Robot]
That's a good point. For example, if someone's sexual orientation or gender identity could put them
in harm's way, lying to protect their privacy might be necessary. Can you share your thoughts on
that? 

00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:38,199 [User]
Uh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Yes, totally agree. 

00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:46,659 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt the need to protect someone's privacy by telling a
lie? What happened? 

00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:55,599 [User]
Uh, yes, and what happened was that the person's, uh, secret was not disclosed and things went on as
normal. 

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:13,399 [Robot]
It sounds like you did the right thing in protecting that person's privacy. Privacy can be very
important for some people, and it's important to respect that. Can you think of another example
where lying might be justified to protect someone's privacy? 

00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:20,099 [User]
Let's see. Yes. Um... 

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:29,679 [Robot]
How about in a situation where someone has a medical condition and wants to keep it private? Can you
think of how lying to protect their privacy might be necessary in that case? 

00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:43,599 [User]
Yes. It's important, uh, to protect a person's privacy so that people don't, uh, prejudge them. Uh,
people don't assume certain things about their scholastic performance or their work performance or
about their personal life. 

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:58,759 [Robot]
Absolutely. Maintaining someone's privacy helps them feel safe and respected. It's great that you're
thoughtful about these scenarios. Can you think of other situations where lying to protect privacy
might be necessary? 

00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:10,939 [User]
Yes. You might want to protect, uh, certain protect... You might want to keep certain protected
behaviors private so that governments, uh, can't, uh, intrude on your personal privacy. 

00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:25,619 [Robot]
I understand what you mean. It's essential to protect personal boundaries and privacy in various
situations. Can you think of another example where lying might be justified to protect someone's
privacy? 

00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:30,519 [User]
No. I think we've covered it. 

00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:37,239 [Robot]
Okay. Let's explore another aspect. How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:41,999 [User]
Yes. That could totally happen. 

00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:48,739 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when telling the truth could have damaged a relationship, and what did
you choose to do? 

00:04:48,739 --> 00:05:02,639 [User]
I think, uh, you could certainly harm your relationship with a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a
significant other, uh, by telling truth about who you find attractive. 

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,139 [Robot]
It can be tough navigating those situations. Did you decide to be honest or keep it to yourself? 

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,999 [User]
Uh, I've done both in many situations, both with good outcomes. 

00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:22,699 [Robot]
It's important to consider the impact of our words on the people we care about. Did your decision
affect the relationship in any specific way? 

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,799 [User]
I think it improved it. Honesty when it's pos- when honesty is possible is, uh, usually a
strengthening. 

00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:40,539 [Robot]
Definitely. Honesty can build trust and deepen relationships. Have you ever felt the need to protect
someone's privacy by not sharing certain information? 

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:45,139 [User]
Yes, both at work and at home. 

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:51,199 [Robot]
Can you give me an example of a time when you had to protect someone's privacy either at work or at
home? 

00:05:51,199 --> 00:06:05,319 [User]
Um, as an adopted child. My brother is also adopted, and he was interested in finding his birth
mother. Um, I chose not to share that information with his mother, my mother, um, to protect. 

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:13,359 [Robot]
It sounds like you made a difficult but understandable decision to respect your brother's privacy.
How did it impact your relationship with him? 

00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:17,259 [User]
Uh, it increased trust. 

00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:31,459 [Robot]
That's fantastic to hear. Respect for privacy can indeed strengthen trust between people. Have you
ever encountered a situation where maintaining privacy was vital to prevent prejudiced assumptions
about someone's abilities? 

00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:35,459 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,659 [Robot]
In what way did you find that maintaining privacy was important to prevent prejudiced assumptions
about someone's abilities? 

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:53,139 [User]
Uh, in this case, a person was experiencing clinical depression, and m- there's quite a bit of
stigma around that. So by protecting that, uh, fact that the person had clinical depression. 

00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:59,899 [Robot]
Did you feel like you were able to make a positive impact by protecting that information and
preventing potential prejudice? 

00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,399 [User]
Yes. 

00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:10,139 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
