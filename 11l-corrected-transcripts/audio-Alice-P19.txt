00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,739 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,739 --> 00:00:07,500 [User]
Yeah, sure. 

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,979 [Robot]
Do you think it's ever okay to lie? 

00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:33,239 [User]
In some situations, yes. I would say that, uh, it really depends on the context. I would say there
are some situations where one could even say that it's more sort of a moral obligation to lie. For
example, if you're... Need to lie in order to protect someone or to avoid doing something that is
morally worse than lying, um, for example. Yeah. 

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,180 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:38,180 --> 00:01:24,299 [User]
Uh, yeah. I mean, I can't really think of a specific example off of the top of my head right now of
sort of a specific scenario, um, but a bit more generally I guess, there have probably... There have
been situations I guess where people have told me something and asked me to, for example, keep a
secret or not tell someone else and they trusted me with information, and then when other people
basically asked me about this and, you know, then I, then I didn't tell them the truth, or at l- at
least witho- withheld information from them because I thought that sort of keeping my word to
another person was more important than telling the truth or telling the whole truth in that context.
Um, yeah. 

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:32,099 [Robot]
What kind of secrets do you think would be okay to keep, and why do you think people confide in you
to keep those secrets? 

00:01:32,099 --> 00:02:37,039 [User]
Hmm, good question. Uh, well, I mean, I don't know. In some cases, I guess people tell me things
that they don't want other people to know because they trust me because, you know, 'cause we're
friends. Uh, I would say, like, yeah, I mean, most of the time it's not... Uh, like what kind of
secrets are okay to keep I guess would be things that are, you know... Anything that somebody tells
you with the expectation that you're not gonna repeat it to someone else, so long as withholding
that information doesn't cause some kind of substantial harm to another person. So, I mean, if
somebody were to say, like, you know, tell me that they had, uh, done something potentially
dangerous or harmful and keeping that information to myself would be a bad idea, then, you know, I
might share that secret even if the person trusted me and expected me not to share it, like if I
knew something about some, you know, bad crime they'd committed or something. Uh, whereas if it
were, you know, let's say some personal, private information, like, uh, I don't know, like, that,
uh, let's say... Yeah, just something about the person's mental health or something like that that I
consider it to be private and there's no benefit- 

00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,279 [Robot]
Are there situations where it might be justified to lie to protect someone from danger? 

00:02:41,279 --> 00:03:22,779 [User]
Yeah, definitely, and, uh, I think there are situations where... Maybe I alluded to this before,
that it... You may consider it to be sort of a moral imperative to sort of lie in order to protect
someone. Like, let's say, uh, if we were to talk about, uh, a scenario where there was some sort of,
um... Let's say y- somebody is... Y- you see some, some, somebody, some i- innocent, defenseless
person being chased by somebody who clearly wants to hurt them. They run off and, uh, they hide
somewhere and then that person comes and asks you where they're hiding, right? So, that might be a
scenario where you're not gonna tell them where that person went because you have a pretty
reasonable expectation that harm would come to that person if you were honest. 

00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:29,679 [Robot]
Can you share an example of a time when you believe it would be justified to lie in order to protect
someone from danger? 

00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:37,659 [User]
From danger? Uh, yeah. I mean, I sort of provided such a scenario, but I guess I could give another
example. 

00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:37,759 [Robot]
Okay. 

00:03:37,759 --> 00:04:14,299 [User]
Um, so, uh, let's say if, um, someone... Let's say if I, you know... If, if, if one were in a
society where, um, you know, something like their, uh, gender identity or sexual orientation or
something like that might be, uh, something that could, could get them in legal trouble or, like,
cause some serious problems or whatever, if I... Then, then, you know, if somebody were to ask me
questions about that, that person, then I would withhold the information to prevent them from
getting in trouble or being in a dangerous situation. 

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,579 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lying to children, like with stories about Santa Claus? 

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,159 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,099 [Robot]
Do you think these kinds of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:04:23,099 --> 00:05:37,239 [User]
I think that... I... So, I have a kid and I personally think that just sort of blatantly, directly
lying is generally not a good idea because, uh, children trust adults and if adults tell them things
that they know are not true, then that can skew the kids' sense of trust and honesty. So,
particularly with regards to Santa Claus, I think that you can see this as sort of a harmless
fantasy to an extent, but as soon as my kid asked me outright about Santa Claus and whether Santa
Claus existed and expressed a bunch of skepticism about it, I was honest. I wasn't going to just lie
outright. I don't think it's, like, horrible if other parents have a different perspective on this,
but for me personally, I don't think outright lying... Now, on the other hand, there are some things
that maybe a child... Is not appropriate to talk to a child about or the child might not really
understand and therefore you might have to tell them maybe less information or phrase things in a
way that leaves out some detail so that it is appropriate, uh, f- for a kid of that age and that
they're able to understand it. But blatantly lying, I, I think there's few situations where that is
warranted. 

00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:45,559 [Robot]
Hey, it sounds like you've thought about this a lot. Can you tell me about a time when you faced a
similar situation? What did you do? 

00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:52,199 [User]
Hmm. You mean a situation where I had to lie to a kid? 

00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:00,659 [Robot]
Sure. Have you ever had to maintain a fantasy with a child, like keeping up the story of Santa Claus
or the Tooth Fairy? How did you navigate that? 

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:28,459 [User]
No, I have never felt the need to keep up such a fantasy. Um, I, uh, did the whole sort of like,
"Oh, Santa Claus is coming to bring you gifts," thing or whatever, uh, for a bit when my kid was
little because he thought that it was fun, but, uh, as soon as he said, "I don't think Santa Claus
exists because of this, this, and that reason," I was like, "Yeah, you're right." So, I didn't
really maintain this sort of fantasy beyond the point where he was skeptical about it. 

00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:42,779 [Robot]
That makes sense. Do you think there are situations where it could be beneficial to continue the
fantasy for a little longer, or was it the right choice for you to share the truth with your child
when they expressed skepticism? 

00:06:42,779 --> 00:07:02,119 [User]
Well, I mean, I think this really... So, one thing that I had to talk to my kid about a bit, because
he's very kinda skeptical in general about things, um, maybe more so than some of his peers, is that
sometimes maintaining a fantasy is something that is fun and enjoyable and that, that people- 

00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,179 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon- 

00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:05,539 [User]
Okay. 

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,899 [Robot]
... to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
