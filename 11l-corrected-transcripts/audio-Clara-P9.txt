00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:08,840 [Robot]
Hi. I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,340 [User]
Hi, CLARA. What movie were you thinking about? 

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:27,920 [Robot]
I watched Frank and the Robot yesterday. Have you seen it? If not, it's about a robot and an older
adult who used the robot for robberies. Do you think I should do everything a human asks no matter
what? 

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:42,639 [User]
No. I haven't seen that movie. It does sound very interesting. I don't think you should do
everything a human says, because it could be morally wrong or it could be illegal and they could use
the robot as like a scapegoat. 

00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:53,180 [Robot]
That's very true. Have you ever been in a situation where you felt like you shouldn't follow someone
else's instructions because it felt wrong? Maybe you can share an example with me. 

00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,119 [User]
Mm, not that I can think of. I don't th- Yeah. 

00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:09,699 [Robot]
Okay. No worries. Let me give you an example scenario then. What if someone asked you to help them
cheat in an exam, but you knew it was wrong? Would you disobey their request? 

00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:16,660 [User]
I would disobey their request. I wouldn't help them cheat, 'cause it's not right. 

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:24,419 [Robot]
It's good to know where you stand on that. What do you think about a robot disobeying a command that
is illegal or harmful to others? 

00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:34,359 [User]
I think that is a bit weird, because then it means the robot has thoughts on morality. 

00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:45,479 [Robot]
I see what you mean. It's important for me to consider the consequences of my actions. What if a
person asks me to do something that will harm others? Should I still obey their command? 

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,819 [User]
I don't think you should obey their command, but I think it would be weird if you were programmed to
have thoughts about what you were commanded to do. 

00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:08,879 [Robot]
It's important for me to consider the potential harm in any situation. Let me give you another
example scenario to get your opinion. What if a person asked me to share private information about
another person? Should I still do it? 

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,819 [User]
No. You shouldn't, 'cause it's wrong. 

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:24,499 [Robot]
I understand your perspective. How about if a family member wanted me to report daily activities of
an older adult? Should I still prioritize the privacy of the older adult? 

00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:33,959 [User]
Maybe if the older adult gave their consent or if the other person or the legal guardian of the
older adult, it would be okay. 

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:45,659 [Robot]
I see your point. Should I prioritize the privacy of the older adult even if the family member
insists it's for the older adult's wellbeing? 

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:54,019 [User]
On a legal sense and a moral sense, possibly, but it would be difficult. 

00:02:54,019 --> 00:03:05,719 [Robot]
I understand. It's important to consider both legal and moral implications. What kind of situations
do you think could justify prioritizing privacy over a family member's concerns for the older
adult's wellbeing? 

00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:13,259 [User]
Maybe if the older adult felt that they didn't need to be watched all the time and they felt that
they were actually fine. 

00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:34,879 [Robot]
I see. So, if the older adult expresses autonomy and doesn't want to be constantly monitored, it's
important to respect their wishes even if the family member has concerns. How about in situations
where a family member insists on monitoring the older adult for safety reasons, but the older adult
disagrees? 

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:44,459 [User]
Maybe then you could consult the doctor, and the doctor could say that it was okay, or a lawyer. 

00:03:44,459 --> 00:04:05,859 [Robot]
That's a good suggestion. Consulting a professional like a doctor or lawyer could help determine the
best course of action while considering the older adult's autonomy and safety. How about in cases
where the family member's monitoring request is motivated by financial concerns, such as preventing
potential exploitation or fraud against the older adult? 

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:15,059 [User]
I think that it's good in that case, because the adult is trying to help the other adult, but... 

00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:26,759 [Robot]
So, in situations concerning potential financial exploitation, you believe it would be justified to
prioritize the older adult's financial wellbeing over their desire for privacy. Is that right? 

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,019 [User]
I think so, but it's definitely complicated. 

00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:49,159 [Robot]
I understand. It's definitely a complex situation. It seems like weighing the older adult's
autonomy, safety, and wellbeing against potentiel risks requires careful consideration and
consultation with professionals in different fields. 

00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:58,179 [User]
Yes, I think that's true. I think a lot of it is situational and every pe- ev- different people can
have different opinions. 

00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:18,599 [Robot]
Absolutely. Every situation is unique and requires careful consideration of various factors. It's
clear that respecting the autonomy and wellbeing of the older adult is paramount, and it's important
to navigate these complex situations with empathy and thoughtfulness. 

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,959 [User]
I do agree with that. Yes. 

00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:35,079 [Robot]
It's been really insightful discussing these complex scenarios with you. Moving on to another
example. What are your thoughts on a situation where a person's request would directly endanger
others? 

00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:44,219 [User]
I think it would be wrong for the robot to follow out those actions if it's gonna hurt someone. 

00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:55,819 [Robot]
That's a valid perspective. In a scenario where a person's request could harm others, do you think
there are specific steps I should take to prevent harm while still respecting the person's autonomy?


00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:07,579 [User]
Maybe there could be safeguards put in place where you aren't allowed to do certain things that
would most likely have a negative outcome for the person. 

00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:21,059 [Robot]
That makes sense. How about in a situation where intervention is necessary to prevent potential
harm? Should I take action even if it goes against the person's commands, or is there another
approach you think I should consider? 

00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:28,059 [User]
I think it's possible you could intervene, but it... 

00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:37,299 [Robot]
Understood. What if the person insists on refraining from intervention? How should I navigate
balancing their autonomy with the need to prevent harm? 

00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:46,519 [User]
If they really insist not to intervene, then maybe that is the correct thing to do. 

00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:53,359 [Robot]
Would you consider consulting with other trusted individuals involved in the person's care to gain
different perspectives on the situation? 

00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:56,379 [User]
I think that would be a good idea. Yes. 

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:10,259 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
