00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:05,920 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,079 [User]
Sure, Alice. 

00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,699 [Robot]
When do you think it's okay to lie? 

00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:31,939 [User]
I think it's okay to lie when... for example, if your friend says, "Does this look good on me?"
(laughs) Um, maybe a good r- I mean, I wouldn't say, "Yes," if it doesn't, but I wouldn't say, "No,
it really doesn't." 

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,259 [Robot]
So when it's about sparing someone's feelings, you think it's okay to lie sometimes. 

00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:36,720 [User]
I do. 

00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,879 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:40,879 --> 00:01:04,139 [User]
I think it's, um... The example I gave. A friend was asking rather recently, um, "Does this look
good on me?" And, and it didn't. It really didn't. Um, the clothing she was trying on. Um, so I
said, "Oh, yeah, I think this color is better," or, you know, said, said, "Oh, well, why don't you
try this instead?" But I didn't say... um, yeah, I didn't say, "No," which was the truth. 

00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:09,039 [Robot]
How did your friend react when you gave them your opinion on the clothing? 

00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:14,219 [User]
Um, she said, "Oh, yeah, okay. Well, maybe I'll try the other color." So, it worked pretty well. 

00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,419 [Robot]
Do you think it deepened your friendship by being honest about your friend's clothing choices? 

00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:28,459 [User]
It depends on where you're at in your friendship, but we've known each other for a long time, so,
yeah, I think it did. But if it was a new relationship, maybe not. 

00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:34,779 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,379 [User]
What's the question? 

00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:49,639 [Robot]
What about when being completely honest could damage a relationship? Like if a friend asks for your
opinion on something important to them, like a project or something they've been working on for a
long time? 

00:01:49,639 --> 00:02:07,659 [User]
I think there are different ways to communicate something. I mean, I, I usually wouldn't lie in
those situations, but I would probably focus on... probably adjust the focus rather than lie. 

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:16,619 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example where telling the truth could potentially damage the
relationship? What did you do in that situation? 

00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:25,679 [User]
Uh... I can't think of anything off the top of my head. 

00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:37,719 [Robot]
How about if lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you share a situation where you would
consider lying to protect someone and what you would do in that case? 

00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:52,539 [User]
To protect someone from danger. I don't really know any people who are in danger. Um... possibly
saying I haven't seen someone if someone's trying to get away from an abusive ex, possibly. 

00:02:52,539 --> 00:03:01,539 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about a time when you considered lying to protect someone from danger or harm?
What happened and how did you handle the situation? 

00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:10,599 [User]
I can't really think of a situation where I've lied to protect someone from danger or harm. 

00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:19,799 [Robot]
Danger. What types of situations do you think would justify lying to protect someone's safety or
wellbeing? 

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:39,159 [User]
Um, possibly in the case of abuse, um, for a child or an adult. Um, lying to get them safe, to
safety. Uh, lying that I don't know their whereabouts. Hmm. 

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,119 [Robot]
How do you think the timing of revealing the truth in such situations can impact the outcome? 

00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:55,299 [User]
Well, in these situations, I think safety is the priority. So, um, yeah, I don't know that I would
reveal the truth if it was in those situations. 

00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:12,619 [Robot]
It's important to consider the potential risks and benefits of revealing the truth in such sensitive
situations. Do you think there are any other scenarios where lying could be justified to protect
someone's wellbeing? 

00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,779 [User]
Hmm. 

00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:25,579 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets? Do you think it's okay to keep certain information to yourself to
protect someones failings or saffety? 

00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:44,879 [User]
Or safety. Okay. Um... Lying to keep someone safe. I don't know. I think I have a pretty uneventful
life (laughs). I don't think that me lying would keep someone safe, um, in any situations that I've
experienced recently. 

00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:54,219 [Robot]
How about if lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you share a situation where you would
consider lying to protect someone and what you would do in that case? 

00:04:54,219 --> 00:05:44,259 [User]
Um, I... The example that comes to mind is if I was at a bar and I saw a girl have a conversation. A
guy came up to a girl who was nearby me, and he was like, "Oh, yeah," and he was hitting on her, and
she was not at all interested. Um, I have gone up to... I remember once I went up to someone else, I
was like, "Oh, hey, it's been so long since I've seen you," so that that guy didn't think that the
girl was alone. Um, I don't know her, so, I mean, I guess it was a lie that I... it's been a long
time since I've seen her. But mainly it was just so that she felt safe and, yeah, it seemed like he
was a bit of a creep. But, so that would be an example of lying to keep someone safe. 

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:59,319 [Robot]
That sounds like a situation where lying was necessary to keep someone safe. You acted quickly and
thoughtfully to protect her. Can you think of any other scenarios where lying might be necessary to
ensure someone's safety? 

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:15,979 [User]
Hmm. Um... not really. I mean, yeah. I'm a pretty straightforward person and don't generally
(laughs) lie very often. 

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:29,399 [Robot]
How about if you were in a situation where telling the truth might harm someone's feelings, like
commenting on their appearance? Can you think of a time when you face such a situation, and how did
you handle it? 

00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:36,599 [User]
I think there's no need to lie. You just don't need to share all of your opinions. 

00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:51,959 [Robot]
That's a considerate approach. What if telling the truth could potentially strain a relationship?
Can you think of a situation where being honest might damage a relationship, and how did you handle
it? 

00:06:51,959 --> 00:07:05,399 [User]
Again, I think, um, you don't always need to share your opinions (laughs). I mean, we all have
opinions about everything, but if you care about your friends' feelings, maybe you don't have to
share your opinions about, um, whatever it is. 

00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:12,459 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
