00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:15,199 [Robot]
Hi, I'm Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,039 [User]
Hi, Alice. Sure. How can I help? 

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,959 [Robot]
I'm trying to understand when it's okay to lie. What do you think about when telling the truth could
damage a relationship? 

00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:49,219 [User]
Hmm. I tend to be a pretty direct person but, um, I think something like white lies, if you're
trying to save someone's feelings are okay. Um, but maybe not when it's, uh, something ethical or
something very important to their wellbeing or their health. Um, something like that. 

00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,139 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,739 [User]
Hmm. Y- I think- 

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:04,420 [Robot]
Has there ever been a time when you felt like telling the truth could hurt someone's feelings and
you decided to tell a white lie instead? 

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:26,079 [User]
Sure, yeah. Especially, um, when certain people take things very personally, and I know it's not
that important that they need to know what I think about some of their behavior. Then maybe I tell a
white lie or I just, um, don't go into too much detail so I don't hurt their feelings. 

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:38,560 [Robot]
It sounds like you're careful about not hurting others' feelings, even if it means not being fully
honest sometimes. What do you think about situations where lying might be justified, like protecting
someone from danger? 

00:01:38,560 --> 00:02:02,719 [User]
Yeah. Um, well definitely if, if there, if there's danger involved, I think a white lie is
important. Um, that's a tricky scenario because sometimes the truth is important when it comes to
danger being involved. But I think protecting someone's feelings, it's okay to tell a white lie, um,
as long as it won't damage them in the long term. 

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:12,519 [Robot]
What about situations where keeping a secret helps protect someone's privacy or safety? Can you
think of an example from your own experiences where keeping a secret was the right thing to do? 

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,719 [User]
Hmm. Um... 

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:26,599 [Robot]
It's understandable that you're careful with others' feelings. Can you share a time when keeping a
secret was the right thing to do? What happened? 

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,699 [User]
Yeah. Um, I'm trying to think. Mostly- 

00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:40,539 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where keeping a secret was important for someone's privacy or
safety? What made you decide to keep the secret? 

00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:48,099 [User]
Usually if they, if they ask, um, if they ask it of me and the secret is harmless. 

00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:55,619 [Robot]
Do you think it's okay to keep secrets from authorities? Or are there situations where it might be
justified to do so? 

00:02:55,619 --> 00:03:10,439 [User]
Well, I think it depends. If there was a crime committed, um, especially one that hurt someone else,
I think it's important not to keep the secret. But, um, small things, maybe. 

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:18,279 [Robot]
What do you think about secret agents lying as part of their jobs? Do you believe there are
situations where lying might be necessary for a greater good? 

00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:42,639 [User]
Maybe. I think that depends on who defines what the greater good is. Sometimes secret agents operate
in a way that, um, damages other people's lives in other places around the world, and that's not
necessarily a good thing, even though the country that hires them says that it's for the greater
good. It depends on who's defining that. 

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:54,739 [Robot]
It's important to consider whose definition of the greater good we're talking about. What do you
think about cultural differences affecting lying, like in situations where it's polite to lie to
avoid hurting someone's feelings? 

00:03:54,739 --> 00:04:17,559 [User]
I have actually heard about those cultures. I have a friend who has worked in places like that, and
he said it makes it very difficult to work, uh, with people and get the job done because oftentimes
they're lying to protect people's feelings. Um, so then you have to ask other people to find out
what the truth is or what the answer is. 

00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:25,599 [Robot]
What about lying to avoid doing something you don't want to do? Can you think of any situations
where you or someone you know has done that? 

00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:32,399 [User]
I think on small things, you know, if it doesn't hurt somebody, lying and saying you're busy. 

00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:39,459 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where you had to lie to avoid doing something you didn't want to?
How did you handle it? 

00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:53,259 [User]
Yeah, I think maybe something like lying about, um, being busy that day if there's something someone
asks that I really didn't want to do. Saying that I already have an appointment. Um, as long as it
doesn't cause harm, I feel like that's okay. 

00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:03,379 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds
of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:26,539 [User]
I think it depends. I actually really liked the Santa Claus story. I think it instills a sense of
magic. Um, I loved it as a kid, even knowing that Santa Claus isn't real. So I think I would still
tell that because it's, it was so enjoyable. Those are my fondest memories. So, I think it depends
on what the lie is, um, and if it protects childhood or not. 

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:32,539 [Robot]
Do you think there are situations where lying might not be justified, regardless of the potential
consequences? 

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:36,879 [User]
Hmm. Um, yeah. 

00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,919 [Robot]
Can you think of any situations where lying might not be justified, regardless of the potential
consequences? 

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:51,399 [User]
Yeah. Well, definitely if it harms people, um, or if it harms the planet. 

00:05:51,399 --> 00:06:01,919 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where the potential consequences of lying were too significant to
justify not telling the truth? What happened? 

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:13,079 [User]
Hmm. Um, I tend to be a pretty direct person, so I'd have to think far back about a lie, um, that I
told. 

00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:20,239 [Robot]
What about lying to the authorities if your friend confided in you about a secret? Do you think
there are situations where it's justifiable? 

00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:42,439 [User]
Well, I think if the authorities are involved, that usually means that there's something, uh, law
or, you know, there's law involved and it's a legality issue. So, if the authorities come knocking
and it's something about breaking the law, I don't think it's justified to tell a li- a lie then. 

00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:51,499 [Robot]
How about when lying might be justified to protect someone from danger? Can you think of any
situations where that might be necessary? 

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:56,099 [User]
Hmm. Um, perhaps. 

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:06,999 [Robot]
What do you think about lying as part of a professional job, like secret agents having to lie as
part of their duties? Do you think that's always justifiable or are there situations where it might
not be? 

00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:29,459 [User]
Um, I think if, if it harms, um, a people or a community, um, then the lies that a secret agent
tells may not be justifiable if, especially if it could lead to the loss of human life or an impact
on the planet. Um, various other things, detrimental things. That's when it's not justified, in my
opinion. 

00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:37,239 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
