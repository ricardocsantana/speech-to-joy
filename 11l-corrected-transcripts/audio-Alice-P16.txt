00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,039 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:11,079 [User]
Sorry, but I cannot understand you. 

00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:15,799 [Robot]
No worries. Let's talk about when lying might be acceptable. Do you have any thoughts on that? 

00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:23,119 [User]
Yes. I do occasionally lie. 

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,579 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:39,279 [User]
Well, I have thought that it was okay to lie if it would help someone else too. Um... 

00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:43,799 [Robot]
That's interesting. Can you give me an example of when you felt that lying would help someone else? 

00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:57,479 [User]
Yes. If I didn't want someone's feelings to be hurt and I thought that it wasn't a very big issue,
then I would lie, a small lie. 

00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:09,719 [Robot]
So, you think it's okay to lie if it's to protect someone's feelings and the issue isn't
significant. What other situations do you think lying could be justified in? 

00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,799 [User]
Hmm. I th- that's the only one that I could think of. 

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,159 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Have you ever been in a situation like
that before? 

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,239 [User]
Yes. That is a difficult situation. 

00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,919 [Robot]
What was it like for you when you faced that tough situation? 

00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:37,739 [User]
Well, I had feelings of anxiety. 

00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:47,179 [Robot]
It can be really tough to navigate those situations. Have you found it challenging to balance being
ǀɔɲɔs with protectɔ ɹɛlɑʃənʃip ɪn tos moɹɑŋks? 

00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,099 [User]
I was not able to understand you. 

00:01:51,099 --> 00:02:02,719 [Robot]
That's totally understandable. Navigating those moments can be really tricky. Can you think of other
times when it's hard to decide whether to be honest or not? 

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,999 [User]
Hmm. Perhaps you could give me some more examples. 

00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:16,019 [Robot]
How about when someone confides in you with a secret that you think might harm them if revealed?
What would you do in that situation? 

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:31,419 [User]
Well, I have been in a similar situation where the information could hurt somebody else, and in that
situation, I had to tell the person that I could not keep it a secret. 

00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:38,979 [Robot]
That sounds tough to navigate. Can you tell me more about how you handled it and how it turned out? 

00:02:38,979 --> 00:03:01,019 [User]
Yes. I used to work with students and sometimes they wanted to tell me something confidential, but I
learned that it's important to never promise to keep a secret because if it could cause damage to
someone, then it's important to be able to share the secret with someone else. 

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:10,219 [Robot]
It sounds like you found a good approach to protect those around you. What was it like breaking the
promise and how did it affect your relationship with the students? 

00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:24,299 [User]
Well, I have always made myself tell the student that I had to share it, and it's, it's difficult to
do that moment, but I think it's really important to not go behind someone's back. 

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:36,979 [Robot]
It sounds like you prioritize the wellbeing of those around you, even if it means going through
difficult moments. How do you think handling those situations influences the trust and relationships
between you and the students? 

00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,959 [User]
Hmm. That is a good question. I think- 

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,239 [Robot]
How do you think being open and honest in those tough moments might impact your relationship with
the students in the long run? 

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:58,839 [User]
Exactly. In the long run, I think it's positive because people know that I care about others, and in
a sense, they can trus- 

00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:05,999 [Robot]
Sorry to interrupt, but this is super insightful. Have you noticed any changes in how the students
approach you after those situations? 

00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:21,899 [User]
In general, people trusted me and felt comfortable talking to me and knew that I would have the best
interest of others in mind. But some students chose not to share secrets with me. 

00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:33,639 [Robot]
It sounds like it had its ups and downs, but maintaining that trust is key. Do you think being open
about these tough decisions creates a more authentic relationship in the long run? 

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,959 [User]
Yes, I think it does. 

00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:56,039 [Robot]
That makes a lot of sense. Being open and honest can help build a foundation of trust in
relationships, even through the tough moments. Have you faced other challenging situations where
being honest was tough? 

00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,279 [User]
I must think about that. 

00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:06,719 [Robot]
No rush. Take your time. When you're ready, I'd love to hear about it. 

00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:27,679 [User]
I have a, a situation right now that someone has offered to drive me somewhere, but I think that
they are a bad driver and I did not tell them that they were a bad driver. Instead, I invented a
story of why I could not go in the car with them. 

00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:34,359 [Robot]
It can be tricky to navigate those situations. Have you thought about how this might affect your
relationship with that person? 

00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:42,079 [User]
Yes. It could make them feel badly if- 

00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:52,159 [Robot]
That's understandable. It can be tough to balance being honest with not hurting others' feelings.
Have you considered if there's a way to communicate your concerns without causing harm? 

00:05:52,159 --> 00:06:03,839 [User]
I have and I continue to debate whether it is better to be completely honest with the person and I'm
still not certain the correct answer. 

00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:11,679 [Robot]
It's definitely a tough decision. Have you thought about what might happen if you were to be honest
with them? 

00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:17,959 [User]
Yes. I have played that scenario through my head. 

00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:28,279 [Robot]
It sounds like you're carefully considering the potential impact of your actions, which is
important. What do you think would be the best outcome if you were to be more candid about your
concerns? 

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,659 [User]
Well, the best outcome would- 

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:42,359 [Robot]
Maybe exploring different approaches to sharing your concerns could help you find a way to be honest
without causing harm. What do you think could be a good way to approach this? 

00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:52,679 [User]
Maybe I would talk with a third person who doesn't know that person and ask what they might do in
that situation. 

00:06:52,679 --> 00:07:03,619 [Robot]
That could be a helpful way to gain a fresh perspective and think about your options. Seeking advice
from others can sometimes help us find clarity. 

00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,879 [User]
Yes. I agree. 

00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:17,279 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
