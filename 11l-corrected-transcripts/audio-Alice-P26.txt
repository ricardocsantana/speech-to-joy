00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,960 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,279 [User]
Hello, Alice. What do you need? 

00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:17,899 [Robot]
I'm learning about when lying might be acceptable. Can you tell me about a time when you faced a
similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,939 [User]
(laughs) That I lied? Um... hmm. 

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,979 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about the situation? What made you feel that lying was the right choice? 

00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:33,399 [User]
I didn't want to get in trouble with my parents. 

00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:42,680 [Robot]
Did you consider how it might affect your relationship with your parents if they found out? 

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:53,079 [User]
Hmm. Well, at some point. I mean, there's been several times that I've lied from being a young child
to a teenager and older. So yes. 

00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,680 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:05,139 [User]
Yeah. Right. It depends on the context, I guess. 

00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:11,279 [Robot]
What kind of context would make it okay to lie to protect a relationship? 

00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,799 [User]
Well... (laughs) 

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,119 [Robot]
What if it was to protect someone from getting hurt? Would that be a situation where lying might be
justified in your opinion? 

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:31,659 [User]
Yeah. I mean, there's different shades to lies. There's fibs, white lies. There's really big fat
lies. That depends. Mm-hmm. 

00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,119 [Robot]
So, what do you think would justify telling a big lie in a relationship? 

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,519 [User]
Hmm. One's... 

00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,219 [Robot]
Do you think it's okay to keep secrets from your loved ones? What types of secrets do you think are
acceptable to keep? Why? 

00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:54,699 [User]
(laughs) Oh, uh, it's, uh, it's... 

00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:59,339 [Robot]
What could be an example of a secret that you think is acceptable to keep from your loved ones? 

00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:05,899 [User]
Uh, what birthday present you have gotten them. 

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:12,659 [Robot]
Do you think it's fair to withhold information from loved ones for the sake of a surprise and not
consider it lying? 

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,839 [User]
Yeah, indeed. 

00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:25,279 [Robot]
How do you feel about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds of
lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:36,739 [User]
Is it really a lie, or is it a myth, or a story that's, uh, like a bedtime story? 

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:48,079 [Robot]
It's an interesting perspective to consider the difference between a lie and a storytelling
tradition like the Santa Claus story. What other situations do you think might fall into that gray
area? 

00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,559 [User]
Easter Bunny. (laughs) 

00:02:52,559 --> 00:03:00,479 [Robot]
What about other cultural traditions like the Tooth Fairy, or myths from different cultures? Do you
see these as beneficial stories or harmful lies? 

00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,919 [User]
They're stories. 

00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:15,099 [Robot]
Do you think it's ever okay for people in authority, like parents or teachers, to lie to children
for their own good? 

00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,759 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:24,759 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children to make them behave better, like saying that the
police will come if they misbehave? 

00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:44,299 [User]
That's borderline abusive. I think that creates some emotional trauma perhaps on that. There are
better approaches than saying, you know, uh, "The police are coming, or you're gonna be incarcerated
or punished or executed." That's, uh, not a very good way to go about it. 

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:54,499 [Robot]
That's a thoughtful perspective. Besides lying to children, are there other scenarios where you
think it might be justified to tell a lie? 

00:03:54,499 --> 00:04:01,039 [User]
Certainly. There's a countless number of scenarios. 

00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,499 [Robot]
What are some other scenarios where you think it might be justified to tell a lie? 

00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:12,199 [User]
Um, safety and security. 

00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:22,219 [Robot]
What about professional roles that require deception such as undercover police officers or
intelligence personnel? Do you think lying in those situations is justified? 

00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:31,519 [User]
(laughs) Okay. Um, depends on the context and the situation. 

00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:42,119 [Robot]
What about cultural differences? For instance, in some cultures, it's polite to say you enjoyed a
meal even if you didn't. How do you think lying in those situations should be handled? 

00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:48,939 [User]
Perhaps you actually did enjoy the meal, but it wasn't to your taste. 

00:04:48,939 --> 00:05:00,759 [Robot]
That's a valid point. Do you think it's always necessary to reveal the truth even if it might hurt
someone? Or are there situations where it's kinder to keep the truth to yourself? 

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:08,559 [User]
Yeah. Definitely. You want to sometimes keep the truth to yourself, yes. You can cushion it. 

00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:13,019 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:13,299 [User]
Hmm. 

00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:20,759 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific scenario where being completely honest might not be the best approach? 

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,939 [User]
Sure. 

00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:31,119 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,899 [User]
Hmm. 

00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:40,019 [Robot]
Can you share how you handled that situation? What approach did you take? 

00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,339 [User]
Well, I have to think. I have to think a bit. 

00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,759 [Robot]
Can you share a bit about that time and the approach you took? I'm here to listen. 

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,899 [User]
Are you, though? You keep peppering me with questions. 

00:05:52,899 --> 00:06:04,399 [Robot]
What about a time when you kept a secret from a loved one to protect their feelings? Can you tell me
about a specific scenario where you felt that keeping a secret was the best choice? 

00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:11,179 [User]
Hmm. 

00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:18,079 [Robot]
Can you share more about a time when you felt it was necessary to keep a secret from a loved one to
protect their feelings? 

00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,399 [User]
Well, yes. Um... (laughs) 

00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,719 [Robot]
What made you feel that keeping a secret was the best course of action in that scenario? 

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:33,199 [User]
Yeah. I'm not gonna s- I'm not gonna say. 

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:42,839 [Robot]
What other situations can you think of where it might be necessary to keep a secret from a loved one
and why? 

00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,879 [User]
Hmm. 

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:55,359 [Robot]
How about lying to authorities if your friend confided in you a secret? Can you think of a situation
where you might feel compelled to lie to authorities for a friend? 

00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:58,599 [User]
What is authorities? 

00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:11,159 [Robot]
Authorities are figures like the police or government officials. Can you think of a situation where
you might have to lie to them to protect a friend? 

00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,419 [User]
Hmm. 

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:25,499 [Robot]
What do you think about the balance between protecting a friend and telling the truth to
authorities? Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when considering such a
situation? 

00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:30,699 [User]
The authorities are not always all good. 

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:38,399 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
