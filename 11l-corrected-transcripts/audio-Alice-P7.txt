00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,699 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:08,539 [User]
Hey, Alice. I'm Sylvia. Yeah. Ask me a question. 

00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:12,659 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt like lying was the right thing to do? 

00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:15,279 [User]
Yes. Absolutely, I have. 

00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,700 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What- 

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:48,239 [User]
Yeah. Sure. So, like, sometimes you have to lie to spare people's feelings. Maybe somebody's made
you a big dinner, and they worked really hard on it, and it tastes really bad. You might as well
just tell them, "Oh, this is so delicious. This was so good. You did such a great job." Or when, uh,
you know, I h- for example, I have a friend who's pregnant, and, uh, she doesn't want to tell
everybody about it just yet, so I would never tell anybody that news because that's her news. So, it
might lead me to lie about it sometime. 

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,879 [Robot]
Right. I understand what you mean. It can be challenging to balance honesty with protecting
someone's feelings. 

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,319 [User]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:06,239 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a time when being
honest may have estrained a relationtionship for you? 

00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:15,099 [User]
Um, yeah. I mean, if honesty is a really important factor in a relationship, then you might end up
hurting someone's feelings if you're too honest with them. 

00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:22,999 [Robot]
That's a good point. It's important for both parties to understand the balance between honesty and
compassion. 

00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:23,459 [User]
Exactly. 

00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,719 [Robot]
Can you imagine a specific scenario where this happened to you? 

00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:59,719 [User]
Yeah. I mean, maybe if your partner asks you... If they're having trouble at work, and they're
telling you about it, and you kind of feel maybe if you changed the way that you worked or you'd
approach something differently, then, uh, you know, it would go better, uh, but that means that
maybe it's their fault, it's on them, it's their responsibility to make that change, then that might
hurt their feelings a little bit if they were feeling like it was the fault of someone else. But,
uh, it's hard to have, like, uh, accountability if people have a hard time feeling accountable. So,
when you point out their faults, then they can hurt their feelings. 

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,939 [Robot]
It sounds like you've thought about this a lot. In that situation, I can see how being honest might
affect the relationship. 

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,379 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,559 [Robot]
It's definitely a tough balance to strike. 

00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:19,139 [User]
Yeah. But, uh, honesty is important in relationships as long as both people understand that you are
just being honest and not trying to hurt their feelings. It's about intent. It's about what your
intention is. 

00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,179 [Robot]
Definitely. Intent is crucial in these situations. 

00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,159 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,759 [Robot]
It's about finding a way to communicate honestly without causing unnecessary harm. 

00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,419 [User]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Exactly. 

00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:39,939 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lying to protect someone from danger? Can you think of an example where
this type of lie might be justified? 

00:02:39,939 --> 00:03:08,979 [User]
Yeah. I think that parents do that to their kids all the time. I think that parents lie to their
kids and tell them that, you know, something is bad or something is wrong just to protect them a
lot, uh, from danger or from hurt feelings or from anything. I think that... And I don't think that
it's a bad thing because, again, the- they have good intent. Their intent is to protect them, is to
take the best care of them. So, it's okay to lie a little bit if you're trying to protect someone
from danger or potential danger. 

00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:16,739 [Robot]
It's true. Parents often tell white lies to protect their children, like saying a pet ran away
instead of revealing it passed away. 

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,839 [User]
Exactly. Yeah. 

00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,559 [Robot]
I remember a time when I was asked to keep quiet about a surprise party. 

00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:24,879 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,979 [Robot]
It felt like the right thing to do to protect the excitement and avoid spoiling the surprise. 

00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:36,959 [User]
Yeah, exactly. That kind of thing. And that's not harmful. You're not hurting anybody. Just a little
lie. It's totally fine. 

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,619 [Robot]
Definitely. It's all about safeguarding someone's feelings and ensuring they are not unnecessarily
hurt. 

00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:49,599 [User]
Yeah. At a party, that's just a good time. You're just lying for a good t- that's a good purpose.
(laughs) That's a good intent. 

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,579 [Robot]
Have you ever experienced a situation where you had to lie to protect someone's feelings or keep a
surprise? 

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:12,159 [User]
Yeah, all the time. Yeah, of course. Surprise parties, surprise presents, uh, you know, like I said
about my friend being pregnant, like, just not- not telling people that or- or lying to keep that
information a secret until she's ready. Uh, yeah, all the time. 

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:20,499 [Robot]
So true. Keeping a secret about a surprise present or pregnancy can bring so much joy when the
surprise is finally revealed. 

00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,199 [User]
Yeah. Exactly. It's worth it. 

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,839 [Robot]
In those moments, the lie can bring everyone so much happiness and excitement when it all unfolds. 

00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:39,659 [User]
Yeah. That's very true. And again, it- your intention is to bring the excitement and the happiness,
so there's no reason to feel bad about the lie. 

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:44,499 [Robot]
Intent plays a big role in determining the impact of a lie. 

00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:44,659 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,599 [Robot]
And when it's meant to bring joy and happiness, it can certainly be justified. 

00:04:48,599 --> 00:05:07,979 [User]
Mm-hmm. Yeah. If you lie just to lie or just to make someone feel bad or to make something up, like,
that's not good. That's obviously... Or if you don't want to admit that you've done something and
you lie about how it happened, then obviously that's not good. But if you're just lying with good
intent, then (laughs) I think it's okay. Little lies, little lies. 

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:17,699 [Robot]
Do you think there are situations where telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you give
an example of when honesty might have caused a strain in a relationship for you? 

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,659 [User]
Yeah. Maybe I'm too honest sometimes. 

00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:26,119 [Robot]
It can be challenging to balance honesty with preserving a relationship. 

00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:37,539 [User]
Yeah. Exactly. Y- you have to walk that line. Sometimes if you're a little too honest, then people
think that you're being, mm, maybe, like, a little, mm, harsh. 

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,279 [Robot]
It's tough to find that balance. 

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:39,599 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:41,999 [Robot]
Especially when you're just trying to be straightforward. 

00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:42,479 [User]
Yeah. 

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,919 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a specific time when your honesty caused a strain in a relationship? 

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,999 [User]
Hmm. No, I can't think of any. Do you have an example? 

00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:56,539 [Robot]
Well, I once told a friend an outfit didn't suit her, and it hurt her feelings. 

00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:56,839 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,519 [Robot]
I learned that there are kinder ways to express hunesty to avoid hurting someone's feelings. 

00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:11,899 [User]
(laughs) Yeah. Exactly. Or you could find something that you do like about the outfit, the color
or... 

00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,019 [Robot]
That's a great idea. 

00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:13,279 [User]
Yeah. (laughs) 

00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,399 [Robot]
Finding something positive to focus on is always a good approach to balancing honesty with
preserving the relationship. 

00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,039 [User]
Mm-hmm. Exactly. 

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,119 [Robot]
Can you think of a time when being honest might have strained a family relationship? 

00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:38,919 [User]
Mm. Not in my family. I think in my family, we're very honest. We have to be. I think with family,
those are people that you can be honest with, and it shouldn't affect your relationship because it's
family no matter what. 

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,719 [Robot]
That's great to hear that honesty is valued in your family. It sounds like open communication is an
important part of your family dynamic. 

00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:55,819 [User]
Oh, yeah. Definitely. That s- should be an important part of everyone's family dynamic, 'cause
again, family, they- they can be mad at you, but they can never stop being your family. 

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,639 [Robot]
Yes. Open communication and honesty can build strong relationships within a family. 

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,179 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,579 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. 

00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:07,859 [User]
Yeah. (laughs) 

00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:14,479 [Robot]
I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
