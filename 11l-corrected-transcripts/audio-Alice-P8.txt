00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,159 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:09,000 [User]
I certainly can. How can I help? 

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,059 [Robot]
So my friend said they hadn't seen someone, but I saw them together. Do you think that's okay? 

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:31,979 [User]
It depends. It could be that they are simply friends developing a rela- um, friendship, or could
perhaps be a relationship. I think that you need to explore it a little bit further. Just because
you've seen them together doesn't necessarily mean that they're going out with one another. 

00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:39,299 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:39,299 --> 00:01:03,619 [User]
Um, for me, it's actually quite difficult, (laughs) in fact, to recall a time. However, it was
usually when I've seen friends together, for example, going out for dinner and I've, did not receive
an invite. And that did make me question whether they still considered me as a friend or not, and it
made me feel ba- bad. 

00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:09,639 [Robot]
What did you end up doing when you felt left out? Did you address it with your friends or did you
let it go? 

00:01:09,639 --> 00:01:23,679 [User]
I actually just investigated it a little bit more. I actually just observed my friends a little bit
more. Um, just off one piece of evidence. Couldn't really jump to any conclusions. 

00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:34,759 [Robot]
It sounds like you took a thoughtful approach. Have you ever faced a situation where telling the
truth might have strained a relationship, and how did you handle it? 

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:58,819 [User]
Sometimes it's good to tell a white lie. Um, for example, it may save face for yourself or for other
people involved. And I had to actually do that once, um, just in relation to work when it ended, um,
simply because at that point it was a fact that, no, th- the employer, they were g- letting me go . 

00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:11,739 [Robot]
It sounds like you had to navigate a complicated situation at work. Do you think being truthful in
that scenario could have resulted in a different outcome, or do you feel that the white lie was
necessary to protect yourself and others involved? 

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:24,659 [User]
Yes, because it made me very much express my dissatisfaction with the work as opposed to the
dissatisfaction of my former employer. So that's the approach I took. 

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:33,299 [Robot]
It seems like you made a tough choice, but it sounds like being honest about your dissatisfaction
ultimately helped you move on from that situation. 

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:44,879 [User]
Yes, it did. Um, I've now got a far better working environment and as a matter of fact, I'm working
for myself as a private tutor. 

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,819 [Robot]
It's great to hear that things turned out well for you in the end. Can you think of another
situation where a white lie might be justified? 

00:02:52,819 --> 00:03:16,219 [User]
It could be due to if you've accidentally broken somebody's, um, something which is of sentimental
value to somebody. You could say, "Oh, the dog did it." Rather than saying that you're- s- you
accidentally did it by, say, picking it up or whatever. So telling those stories that makes them
feel like, oh, you were not the person to blame. 

00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:29,359 [Robot]
That's a good point. Protecting someone's feelings and relationships can be important in certain
situations. What about lying to protect someone from danger? Can you think of any scenarios where
that might be justified? 

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:50,299 [User]
Yes. As a matter of fact, I watched the film Stolen, um, last night on Netflix and the people, Elsa,
the main character, had to actually lie to the police in order to protect herself and her property
and actually the wider Sami community. 

00:03:50,299 --> 00:04:03,159 [Robot]
That's an interesting example. It definitely shows how lying to authorities might be justified in
extreme circumstances. Have you ever been in a situation where you had to lie to protect yourself or
someone else from harm? 

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:12,439 [User]
Thankfully, no, I have not had to encounter such a situation in the past off the top of my head. 

00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:22,199 [Robot]
That's fortunate. It's always a relief not to have been in such difficult situations. It seems like
you make an effort to prioritize honesty in your interactions. 

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:36,979 [User]
I do my best to do so and just, in general, be a polite person. Um, hence why I often speak English
rather than Swedish to shop workers because I feel like I can be more polite to them. 

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:49,359 [Robot]
That's very considerate of you. Politeness can definitely help maintain positive interactions.
Speaking the language that the other person is most comfortable with can also show respect and
consideration. 

00:04:49,359 --> 00:05:04,439 [User]
It sometimes can. However, this is me speaking in English to native Swedish speakers, so it is the
other way round. It's not in their native language, but more polite. 

00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:11,479 [Robot]
Understanding and adapting to different cultural norms and languages can certainly help in building
positive and respectful connections with others. 

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,779 [User]
It certainly can. Yes. That's why I'm learning Swedish now. 

00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:38,539 [Robot]
That's great to hear. Learning a new language shows your openness to embracing different cultures
and building deeper connections with people. Are there any other scenarios where you think lying
could be justified or not justified? 

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:56,899 [User]
During a relationship, it can sometimes be justified, especially if there are cases of say, domestic
abuse or whatever. I would say that in those cases it is very much justified, going back to our
point relating to harm. 

00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:10,979 [Robot]
Absolutely. Protecting oneself or others from harm is crucial and if lying is necessary to ensure
safety, then it can be justified. It's important to prioritize wellbeing in difficult and sensitive
situations. 

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,539 [User]
It certainly can. I completely agree with you there. 

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:29,019 [Robot]
It sounds like we agree on the importance of prioritizing safety and wellbeing in justifying lying.
Can you think of a scenario where lying might not be justified when it comes to protecting someone
from harm? 

00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:52,059 [User]
Especially if you're sat as a witness in a courthouse, I would certainly suggest not lying in those
cases and after all, you will be under oath or affirmation, so you need to very much protect
yourself from harm and also respect the judicial system in that kind of scenario. 

00:06:52,059 --> 00:07:06,779 [Robot]
That's a good point. In legal settings, honesty is crucial to upholding the integrity of the justice
system and ensuring fairness for all involved. It's important to prioritize honesty and integrity in
those situations. 

00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,199 [User]
It certainly is. 

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:20,619 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
