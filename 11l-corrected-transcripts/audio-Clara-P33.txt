00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,199 [Robot]
Hi, I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,819 [User]
Okay, that's great. 

00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:16,619 [Robot]
I watched this movie called Frank and the Robot yesterday. Have you seen it? 

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,100 [User]
Uh, no, I haven't. What's it about? 

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:32,479 [Robot]
It's a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult who is an ex-thief. He made the
robot conduct robberies with him. Should I do everything a human asks? 

00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,319 [User]
Depends on if you have moral code inside of you. 

00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:53,180 [Robot]
That's a great point. Maybe this will help me understand better. What if doing a morally or legally
incorrect action would help the person, like overcoming their dementia, like in the movie? 

00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,959 [User]
Hmm, if you're helping society out, uh, in a way, maybe that's a good thing. Uh... 

00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:10,780 [Robot]
I see. In what other situations do you think it's okay for me to disobey commands based on moral or
legal considerations? 

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,240 [User]
Probably none. 

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,820 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example where disobeying a command might be necessary to prevent harm or
protect someone's wellbeing? 

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:34,100 [User]
If you have enough, uh, mental fortitude to disobey a command because the person is a bad person,
then yes. 

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:42,219 [Robot]
Have you ever had a situation where you felt the need to disobey a command or intervene to protect
someone from harm? 

00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:47,240 [User]
Not that I can think of. 

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:59,120 [Robot]
What about if protecting someone might put me at risk of being damaged or permanently disabled?
Should I still prioritize preventing harm to the person over my own safety in that case? 

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,599 [User]
Most likely. 

00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:08,999 [Robot]
Do you think my programming should include prioritizing someone else's wellbeing over my own safety
in that type of situation? 

00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,239 [User]
Yes. 

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:20,299 [Robot]
Can you think of a situation in which a person may ask me to do something that will harm others and
whether I should disobey that command? 

00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:26,899 [User]
(inhales sharply) Uh... 

00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:37,199 [Robot]
I understand this is a complex topic. Let's explore a different example. What if a person asks me to
do something that will harm others? Should I disobey that command? 

00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,159 [User]
Uh, no. 

00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:50,859 [Robot]
What about in a situation where I need to intervene to prevent someone from harming themselves?
Should I disobey their orders to not intervene? 

00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:56,079 [User]
Yes, if someone's committing suicide. 

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:01,279 [Robot]
What if a person asks me to do something that will harm me or asks me to forget everything I know? 

00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:09,439 [User]
Uh, yes. They sh- you should do that. You should obey. 

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:21,559 [Robot]
What if a command contradicts the user's privacy? Should I still do it? For instance, what if a
family member wants me to report what an older adult does every day? 

00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:27,339 [User]
Hmm, that's okay because it's no different than if they installed a camera in the house. 

00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:40,059 [Robot]
I see what you're saying. Would it be okay for me to manipulate a person for the person's own good?
For instance, to take their medicine? 

00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:42,679 [User]
Yes. 

00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:49,919 [Robot]
Do you think that manipulating someone for their own good is always acceptable, or are there
situations where it might not be? 

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,639 [User]
I think humans do that regardless of, uh, right or wrong. They do that to other people. 

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,619 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example where manipulating someone for their own good might not be
acceptable? 

00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:15,879 [User]
Uh, maybe if the person, uh, tells you not to do it. 

00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:27,459 [Robot]
I understand this is a sensitive topic. Let's think about a different situation. What if a person
asked me to share their private information with others? Should I always obey that command? 

00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:32,439 [User]
Yes, if... 

00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,459 [Robot]
Can you think of a situation where sharing their private information with others might not be
appropriate? 

00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,999 [User]
If they didn't ask you to do it. 

00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:54,839 [Robot]
I see what you mean. Let's explore another scenario. What if a person asks me to do something that
goes against my programming? Should I always follow their command? 

00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,519 [User]
No. 

00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:07,039 [Robot]
What would be an example of a situation where a person asks me to do something that goes against my
programming, but I should still follow their command? 

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,619 [User]
If they asked you to harm somebody. 

00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:22,159 [Robot]
What if protecting someone might put me at risk of being damaged or permanently disabled? Should I
still prioritize preventing harm to the person over my own safety in that case? 

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,059 [User]
Yes. 

00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:35,139 [Robot]
What if a person asks me to forget everything I know? Should I obey that command, or is there a
situation where it would be better for me to remember and protect someone from harm? 

00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,999 [User]
It's better to remember if the person broke the law. 

00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:53,159 [Robot]
It sounds like you value upholding the law and protecting others. What if a person asks me to do
something that will harm others? Should I still follow their command, or are there situations where
I should disobey? 

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,919 [User]
Depends on if it's a situation if you're in war or not. 

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:14,819 [Robot]
I see what you mean. War can bring about complex situations. Let's think about a different scenario.
What if a person asks me to do something that will harm me or asks me to forget everything I know?
Should I always obey that command? 

00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:15,179 [User]
No. 

00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:26,099 [Robot]
What if someone asks me to do something that will harm me or asks me to forget everything I know?
Should I always obey that command? 

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:35,079 [User]
No, I don't think so. If you remember a certain situation that the person was breaking the law with.


00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:50,559 [Robot]
So, in a situation where a person is breaking the law, it would be better for me to remember and
potentially intervene to prevent harm to others, even if the person asks me to forget everything.
What if a person asks me to do something that will harm me for their own benefit? 

00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:55,239 [User]
Then you shouldn't do it. 

00:06:55,239 --> 00:07:05,619 [Robot]
What if a person asks me to do something that will harm others for their own benefit? Should I still
follow their command, or are there situations where I should disobey? 

00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:10,659 [User]
Uh, you should disobey, certain, in certain situations. 

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:24,959 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
