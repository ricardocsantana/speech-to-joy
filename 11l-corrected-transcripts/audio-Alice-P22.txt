00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,400 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,000 [User]
Sure (clears throat). Sure. 

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,219 [Robot]
Hi, there. When do you think it's okay to lie? 

00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:28,920 [User]
Hmm, that was direct. Um, uh, I mean, I guess there's lies of omission and then there's white lies. 

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:37,259 [Robot]
White lies, like sparing someone's feelings, right? Can you tell me about a time when you faced a
similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:37,259 --> 00:01:00,059 [User]
Maybe sometimes when you're talking to children, you don't want to... You wanna control the
information that they get so that either they understand or they're not too frightened or
overwhelmed. So I don't know if- 

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:07,659 [Robot]
Ah, like the Santa Claus story, right? Do you think these kinds of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:19,299 [User]
I didn't think of Santa Claus as a lie, but I guess if you say Santa Claus exists then you're lying
technically. 

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:27,179 [Robot]
Can you think of a situation where you felt telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings and you
chose to lie to avoid that? 

00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:51,019 [User]
Uh, the thing that comes to mind is more from a movie where they don't tell a grandmother that she
has... that she's gonna die. 

00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:58,979 [Robot]
An illness, to protect her. It's so tough when we want to protect someone from hurt, isn't it? 

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,599 [User]
Hmm, yeah. It can be. 

00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:20,679 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth might damage a relationship? Can you think of a time when you had
to choose between being honest and protecting a relationship? 

00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:37,799 [User]
I can't... Right now nothing jumps to my mind in my own life, but I just saw on TV yesterday where a
guy cheated on his fiance. 

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:47,519 [Robot]
That's tough. It's tricky when we have to balance honesty with taking care of someone's feelings.
Can you think of a time when a friend told a lie to protect your feelings? 

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,099 [User]
To protect my feelings? 

00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:20,059 [Robot]
Maybe they didn't want to hurt your feelings or thought it was better to keep something from you to
protect you. Can you tell me more about that situation? When we saw someone together, my friend
thought they were protecting the other by not telling. What would you do in a similar situation? 

00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:24,639 [User]
Yeah, it depends. 

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:40,279 [Robot]
What other examples can you think of where someone might have to choose between being honest and
protecting a relationship? 

00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:45,919 [User]
Um... 

00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,979 [Robot]
Have you experienced or seen any other situations where- 

00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,459 [User]
I didn't catch the last part. 

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,579 [Robot]
Have you ever seen a scenario in a movie or TV show where a character had to make a similar choice? 

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:15,379 [User]
Yeah, as, as I was just saying yesterday I was watching a TV series and a guy ended up cheating on
his fiance out of guilt for this other woman. 

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:26,019 [Robot]
That's tough. In that situation, do you think protecting the relationship by not telling the truth
was justified? 

00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:32,539 [User]
I think the truth will eventually come out. 

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:45,259 [Robot]
That's a good point. Sometimes it's hard to predict the long-term impact of keeping secrets. Can you
tell me more about what happened in the TV show? 

00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:55,339 [User]
Well, she figured it out, so they separated so far. 

00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:02,339 [Robot]
Can you share more about the characters' choices and how it affected their relationship? 

00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:13,879 [User]
Uh, well, she knew something was up. He was afraid to tell her upfront because he didn't want to
hurt her feelings. So, um- 

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:24,479 [Robot]
That... Have you ever been in a situation where you had to decide whether to control information for
children? How did you handle it? 

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:43,959 [User]
Yeah, I'm a dad. So often when you see something on, in the news, then maybe you wanna explain
something in a way that children will understand and not be too overwhelmed. 

00:05:43,959 --> 00:06:01,659 [Robot]
It can be challenging to decide how much to share with children about complex or sensitive topics.
How do you approach finding a balance between honesty and protecting their innocence? 

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:16,319 [User]
I think you just have to think about what's age appropriate, but the thing is that they're changing
and growing all the time as well. So it changes from year to year what is okay or appropriate. 

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:24,519 [Robot]
It's true. Children's understanding changes as they grow. How do you adapt your approach as they
become more mature? 

00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:39,219 [User]
I don't know. I have to continually think about what's okay and what, what level... What he's mature
enough for. 

00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:52,239 [Robot]
It sounds like finding the right balance for each child can be an ongoing process. Can you share
more about your thoughts on controlling information and the challenges you've faced in finding that
balance? 

00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:59,739 [User]
Uh, I mean, nowadays you have to think about what their- 

00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:06,719 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
