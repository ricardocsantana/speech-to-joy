00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,579 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:08,920 [User]
Yeah, of course. 

00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,639 [Robot]
Do you think there's ever a situation where it's okay to lie? 

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,139 [User]
Oh, good question. (laughs) Um, uh- 

00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:19,959 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? 

00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:20,659 [User]
Hmm. 

00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:21,319 [Robot]
What did you do? 

00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:46,079 [User]
Uh, a similar situation would be probably maybe when, uh, I had a f- this is very specific, when I
had a fri- friend group, uh, and two of the people in that friend group were dating, and they broke
up a few months after. And I was very close with both of them, and one of the pers- one of the
people decided to start dating pretty fa- qu- pretty swiftly after, and- 

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,799 [Robot]
It can be tough navigating friendships when relationships change. How did you handle that situation?


00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,639 [User]
(sighs) 

00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,159 [Robot]
Once, I had to keep a secret for a friend who didn't want others to know about their new job offer- 

00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,179 [User]
Hmm. 

00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,600 [Robot]
... until they gave their notice at their current company. 

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:14,940 [User]
Hmm. I feel if you honestly think you're helping and you're not adding more turmoil by keeping a
secret, it could be good, but at the same time in that situation, personally, I would wanna know. 

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,440 [Robot]
How did things turn out in the end? 

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,999 [User]
(laughs) 

00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:21,719 [Robot]
Did your approach and decision to keep the secret help maintain the friendships? 

00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:32,199 [User]
Yeah, uh, one, uh, uh, (sighs) yes with one of the friends. The other friend is not really as a
effect, yeah, not talk to anymore. 

00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:37,059 [Robot]
It's tough when relationships change, but it's good to hear that it worked out with one of your
friends. 

00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:37,460 [User]
Hmm. 

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,139 [Robot]
Would you say it feels like a relief when the decision to keep a secret turns out to be beneficial
in the long run? 

00:01:43,139 --> 00:02:05,259 [User]
Yeah. I feel when you make that decision to keep it kinda more secret, it is a tough, it takes a
toll, I feel, 'cause it's like, well, you wanna know everything, but at the same time, you wanna
keep the person safe in a way and maybe to protect them from some information. So it's hard to make
that decision that you actively do want to lie, no matter if it's a white lie or a big lie. Um,
yeah. 

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,619 [Robot]
It sounds like you've really thought about the impacts of keeping- 

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:08,639 [User]
(laughs) 

00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,099 [Robot]
... secrets on relationships. 

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,039 [User]
Hmm. (laughs) 

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,779 [Robot]
It's true, sometimes we have to weigh the consequences and make tough choices in the moment. 

00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:16,299 [User]
Hmm. 

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,339 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lies used to protect someone from danger? 

00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:35,779 [User]
Oh. (sighs) Yeah, 100%, maybe that is needed. I mean, if it's for the be- if it's for the benefit of
the person (laughs) to be safe, maybe that is the best course of action to lie, but I feel like
lying is, uh, (sighs) it's hard. 

00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:43,839 [Robot]
What about other situations where lying might be justified? Like, have you ever faced a scenario
where telling the truth could have caused harm to someone? 

00:02:43,839 --> 00:03:08,679 [User]
I can't think of a situation, no, where I ha- been in that, yeah, been in that situation. But I feel
like usually (laughs) telling the truth is the right way to go. But if it is for the safety of this
person, that lie is maybe worth it in the long run, but I don't know. I always feel like a lie
always comes up, like the truth always comes out. 

00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:12,839 [Robot]
It makes sense that you prioritize honesty, especially when it comes to safety. 

00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,359 [User]
Hmm. 

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,099 [Robot]
What do you think about lies used to protect privacy or keep personal details confidential? 

00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:40,579 [User]
Well, I don't know how a lie would be with that then. Is it like, are we saying a lie is a, "Okay,
I'm 23, but on a, a site I say I'm 33"? Or like what, how far do we go with the lie to keep our
identity? I don't really understand like to what severity (laughs) would we go to? I mean, is it
like going on Instagram and having a completely different, um, life that you're actually living
or... Yeah. 

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:47,919 [Robot]
Yes, it can vary depending on the situation. For example, using a pseudonym on social media to
protect your identity- 

00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:47,979 [User]
Hmm. 

00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,799 [Robot]
... is different from misleading someone about your age. 

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,119 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:54,299 [Robot]
Both raise questions about honesty and confidentiality. 

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:54,699 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,039 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific situation where you had to consider these factors? 

00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:22,619 [User]
(laughs) Um, oi, (squeaking sound) that's a good question. Oh, sorry. That's a good question. Maybe
when you are on (laughs) a dating app, for example? That is definitely, it's, if you're younger or
if you're older, the, not for me personally, but I think that's a situation where it's like you have
to be upfront on who you are, and a lot of people maybe lie about it. 

00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:26,699 [Robot]
I see. Navigating honesty in online profiles can raise- 

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:26,799 [User]
Hmm. 

00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,259 [Robot]
... ethical considerations. 

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:28,559 [User]
Hmm. 

00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,179 [Robot]
If there's any related experience you'd like to share, I'm here to listen. 

00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:54,979 [User]
No, I don't have any personal experiences with that, um, but I know from a fact like people do lie
no matter who or how old, if it's younger or older, just to get a certain, a certain demographic of
people, uh, which can also be very scary, but also some people have that interest, I guess. So yeah,
I'd say it's pretty interesting when you look at dating profiles, actually. 

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,879 [Robot]
It's true, online interactions can be complex when it comes to honesty and identity. 

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,519 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,319 [Robot]
Have you encountered other situations where authenticity and confidentiality have been important? 

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:13,639 [User]
That's a good question. I don't... Probably. I mean, but I don't think I think about it that much. 

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,879 [Robot]
Is there a context where you've had to consider the boundaries between being authentic- 

00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:17,899 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,579 [Robot]
... and protecting personal information in your offline interactions? 

00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:44,539 [User]
Hmm. Well, for example, I like to post a lot on Instagram and TikTok, for example. I like showing my
life and se- making these videos and showing my friends them and posting them on social media, but
at the same time, it's like if I do post it, it will be there forever. So that kind of constant
reassuring of being like, "Okay, this will not disappear from the internet," is another thing I
have. 

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:50,619 [Robot]
That's a good example. Balancing authenticity in what you share online with creating a safe digital
footprint- 

00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:50,639 [User]
Yeah. 

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639 [Robot]
... is definitely a consideration- 

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:52,819 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,299 [Robot]
... many people grapple with. 

00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:55,739 [User]
Hmm. 

00:05:55,739 --> 00:06:03,119 [Robot]
Can you share a time when you had to carefully manage the information you posted online to maintain
authenticity and privacy? 

00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:26,079 [User]
Definitely. Uh, probably when I publicly kind of posted about my partner. Um, I was very unsure if I
wanted to do that, but at the same time, I wanted to kind of, yeah, sh- t- scream to the world,
"This is who I'm dating." And at the same time, you don't really wanna share it all piece, all those
pieces with the internet. I mean, who are they to know? 

00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,419 [Robot]
That sounds like a challenging balance- 

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:28,659 [User]
Yeah. 

00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,899 [Robot]
... wanting to share your happiness while also protecting- 

00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:30,979 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:31,739 [Robot]
... your privacy and the- 

00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:31,879 [User]
Yeah. 

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,759 [Robot]
... relationship. 

00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,319 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,699 [Robot]
It's important to consider- 

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:35,719 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:43,659 [Robot]
... how posting about personal relationships aligns with your need for authenticity- 

00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:43,679 [User]
Hmm. 

00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:47,799 [Robot]
... and privacy. Can you tell me more about how you navigated that decision? 

00:06:47,799 --> 00:07:06,699 [User]
Yeah, I mean, at the end, it wasn't that hard of a decision, that it was more that I don't really
care actually if people know or do not know, but I thought it would make, it made me happy at that,
in that scenario to be like, "Yep, I don't care," and not being so private about everything as well.


00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,299 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I'm going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon- 

00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:12,319 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,419 [Robot]
... to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
