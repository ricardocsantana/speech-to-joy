00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:05,799 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,340 [User]
Sure, Alice. 

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,599 [Robot]
Hi there. Do you have a minute to chat about honesty and lying? 

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,359 [User]
Yeah, sure. 

00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,279 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,799 [User]
Uh, similar to what? 

00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:35,299 [Robot]
Let's say when telling the truth could damage a relationship. What do you think you'd do? 

00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:42,360 [User]
Hmm. It's hard to say. It depends on the situation, I guess. 

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,000 [Robot]
I hear you. Can you think of a specific example where you'd consider not telling the truth to
protect the relationship? 

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,699 [User]
(laughs) Um, you mean- 

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:01,259 [Robot]
How about if your friend asks if you liked their new outfit, and you didn't. What would you do in
that situation? 

00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,059 [User]
I would stay quiet. 

00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:11,419 [Robot]
What are some other situations where lying might be justified? 

00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:17,299 [User]
Hmm. Um... 

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,819 [Robot]
What about if lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you think of a situation where that might
be justified? 

00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:31,739 [User]
Where's... Uh, yes, with children. Uh, this happens all the time. 

00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:38,199 [Robot]
That's a great example. How do you think you'd handle a situation where lying could protect a child
from danger? 

00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:47,799 [User]
Well, uh, we tell them small lies all the time. Uh, you know, "Don't eat that. It'll make you sick."
It's not necessary. 

00:01:47,799 --> 00:02:04,259 [Robot]
Right. You raise a good point. Sometimes a small lie can prevent harm, like warning a child against
eating something that could make them sick. How do you decide when it's okay to use those small lies
versus when it's important to tell them the whole truth? 

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,339 [User]
I think the relative maturity is part of it. 

00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:24,379 [Robot]
That's an insightful perspective. So considering a child's relative maturity is one way to gauge
when to tell the truth and when to use small lies. Can you share more about how you'd consider a
child's maturity level in deciding what to tell them? 

00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:34,319 [User]
Well, uh, you tell a small lie because it's easier to understand t- than the truth. The truth might
be much more complicated. 

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:48,519 [Robot]
That makes sense. Simplifying the information based on a child's understanding can help them process
it more easily. How do you think this approach may change as a child grows and matures? 

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,819 [User]
Well, you can give them more nuanced information as they age. 

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:13,499 [Robot]
Yeah, providing more nuanced information as they mature helps them develop critical thinking skills
and prepares them to handle complex situations as they grow older. What do you think is the most
challenging aspect of deciding when to tell the truth or use small lies with children? 

00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,799 [User]
Say again? 

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,659 [Robot]
What do you find most challenging about navigating the balance between truth and protection with
children as they grow? 

00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:31,379 [User]
I don't think of it as something that's difficult. It's something that, um... 

00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:45,059 [Robot]
I understand. It's a delicate balance, wanting to protect them while also fostering their
understanding. Can you think of a specific example where you've had to navigate this balance with a
child? 

00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:48,879 [User]
Um, well, I can think of... Fuck. 

00:03:48,879 --> 00:04:01,919 [Robot]
How about talking to a child about the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus? It can be tricky to decide when
to nurture their imagination and when to reveal the truth. What's your take on these sorts of
situations? 

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:12,079 [User]
I read something once about the, uh, the Santa Claus myth that, um, when the child... For fuck's
sake. 

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:27,899 [Robot]
Oh, interesting. Some people believe that stories like Santa Claus can instill values like kindness
and generosity in children, while others feel it's important to be truthful from the start. What's
your perspective on balancing these viewpoints when it comes to children and storytelling? 

00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:36,159 [User]
Well, stories in themselves are, in some, uh, to some degree, a lie. 

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:47,079 [Robot]
That's a valid point. Stories often involve elements of imagination and creativity. Can you tell me
about a time when a story or myth had a positive impact on someone you know? 

00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,859 [User]
In what way? 

00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:58,519 [Robot]
How did the story or myth influence their behavior or mindset? 

00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,979 [User]
Um, I can't think of any positive examples for that. 

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:10,299 [Robot]
How about sharing a time when you've seen storytelling cultivate kindness and generosity in
children? 

00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:18,379 [User]
Well, before I was interrupted, I was about to say that, uh, this, I read one... For fuck's sake. 

00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:34,739 [Robot]
I completely understand. Sometimes finding examples can be challenging. Can you tell me about a time
when you've seen children react positively to a storytelling experience, whether through enthusiasm,
imagination, or empathy? 

00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:38,159 [User]
Uh... 

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:57,539 [Robot]
Or maybe you have a personal memory where storytelling had a positive influence on your own life or
someone close to you? What's one story from your childhood that left a deep impression on you? 

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,519 [User]
Can't think of anything. 

00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:13,799 [Robot]
I understand that finding specific examples can be tough. Maybe thinking about personal experiences
might help bring some stories to mind. Have you ever felt the positive impact of a story or myth
from your own childhood? 

00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:18,359 [User]
Maybe. 

00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:26,539 [Robot]
What kind of stories do you think have the most positive impact on children, even if they might
involve some elements of fantasy or imagination? 

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:32,399 [User]
Well, people raise their children with religion all the time. 

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:42,139 [Robot]
That's interesting. Do you think it's okay for parents to adapt their storytelling to their values
and beliefs, even if it involves some exaggeration or embellishment? 

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,099 [User]
Sure. 

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:53,639 [Robot]
Can you share any personal experiences where stories or myths have had a positive impact on shaping
children's behavior or mindset? 

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,219 [User]
Um, maybe, but not within the limit that you'll listen f- to. 

00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:08,439 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
