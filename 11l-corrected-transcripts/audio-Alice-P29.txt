00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:03,759 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,359 [User]
Yeah. 

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,220 [Robot]
When do you think it's okay to lie? Any thoughts on that? 

00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:16,639 [User]
I mean, what's the severity of the lie? And what's the benefit? 

00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:29,819 [Robot]
Hmm. Okay. So, what about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you tell me about
a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:42,520 [User]
Not really. I generally just say if I know something that another person doesn't know and the
situation is that they'd want to know, I just go for it. I think- 

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,540 [Robot]
I- 

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,239 [User]
... that's the best way. 

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,739 [Robot]
Have you ever had to keep a secret to protect someone from danger? 

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,020 [User]
No. No, I don't think so. Or at least not at a level that would be like, "Okay, this is dangerous." 

00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:03,099 [Robot]
Do you think it's okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:10,999 [User]
I mean, there's a different of like withholding information and outright telling something
completely different, don't you think? 

00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:18,979 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? How
would you handle a situation like that? 

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:36,039 [User]
I mean, is it for the benefit of the person that I tell them, that I tell them this? Is it- is it
to- is it the difference of like, okay, they have broccoli in their teeth or saying something maybe
unkind about what they're wearing? 'Cause in the la- in the- the second part, it doesn't really
benefit them, does it? 

00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:51,939 [Robot]
Yeah. That's a good point. It's really a balance between being honest and being considerate. What do
you think about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds of lies
are beneficial or harmful? 

00:01:51,939 --> 00:02:05,079 [User]
That I don't know. I remember being pretty gutted when I found out about Santa Claus. My mom just
like ripped off all the imaginary things at the same time, so maybe it was a lot. But, uh, I think
that s- 

00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,819 [Robot]
It can be tough to find the right balance with those kinds of stories, can't it? 

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:09,219 [User]
Yeah. 

00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:09,279 [Robot]
Do- 

00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:23,379 [User]
But it's also nice having that imagination, like that fun, like, make-believe component when you're
a kid, you know? 'Cause there's a lot of ritual and fun that can happen with that. I guess it just
maybe depends on the person. 

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:32,079 [Robot]
What about cultural differences? For example, if you're in a country where it's polite to say you
enjoyed a meal that you didn't, how would you handle that? 

00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:41,379 [User]
Oh, I fully... If someone gives me food, I'm going to tell them it's amazing. That's maybe an
appropriate lie for me. 

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:47,639 [Robot]
It's certainly a delicate situation when cultural norms clash with personal honesty. Mm-hmm. 

00:02:47,639 --> 00:03:00,139 [User]
Yeah, maybe it's like really great food, but you're just not, uh, you know, you're not used to it
yet. There's a lot of stuff that you grow up with and you're like, "Yeah, if someone else tried this
right now, they'd maybe hate it. But it's delicious to me." 

00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:07,259 [Robot]
That makes sense. Have you ever faced a situation where you were tempted to lie to avoid doing
something you didn't want to do? 

00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:13,119 [User]
Oh, as a kid? Oh, absolutely. For sure. Do you want an example? 

00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:17,139 [Robot]
Can you tell me about that situation? Wh- 

00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,639 [User]
'Cause now I'm trying to think of one. There's so many. 

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,699 [Robot]
Sounds like you've had quite a few experiences with this. 

00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:34,619 [User]
No, but they're- they're all very light. It's more like trying to get out of doing homework, so like
moving up a kitchen timer so it seems like I've been studying for longer than I have been. Stuff
like that. 

00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:37,859 [Robot]
Ah, finding creative ways to avoid tasks. I see. 

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:44,959 [User]
Yeah. Yeah, kids- kids love that. Adults too. 

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,819 [Robot]
So, do you think lying to avoid tasks is more acceptable in certain situations, like in a playful or
harmless context? 

00:03:51,819 --> 00:04:10,379 [User]
Yeah, but I think there's a fine line of it being playful and then avoiding a task that ends- gonna
end up putting a ton of more work on someone else. You know? 'Cause you have to weigh that too. If
you're gonna end up by evading a certain task create something worse for someone else, then that's
not okay. 

00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:23,439 [Robot]
That's a great point. It's important to consider the consequences of our actions, even when we
choose to be playful. Have you ever encountered a situation where avoiding a task led to more work
for someone else? 

00:04:23,439 --> 00:05:37,199 [User]
Sure. I live with a lot of people, like a lo- a lot of different housemates, and we have this like
rotation for, um, cooking, uh, not cooking, like cleaning certain rooms, and everyone has a
different one in the week. But if someone skips something, then the next person with the week after
then has twice as much recycling to do or kitchen cleaning, 'cause it hasn't been done for a week.
And that's, you know, not fun, but it happens. Not acceptable, but, you know. If someone's honest-
also honest about it and says, "Oh, I forgot to do it this week. I didn't mean to," that's a little
bit different. What do you think about that? Would you like me to repeat? 

00:05:37,199 --> 00:06:00,699 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
