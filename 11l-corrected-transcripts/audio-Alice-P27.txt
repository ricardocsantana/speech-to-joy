00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:04,900 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,239 [User]
Hi, Alice. Sure. 

00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:13,279 [Robot]
When do you think it's okay for someone, or in my case, a robot, to lie? 

00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,899 [User]
I don't know if it's ever good to lie. 

00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,260 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:43,299 [User]
I guess there are degrees of lies. There are white lies and there are really immoral lies. Um, I
have definitely lied in my life, but I really don't like it and I try very hard not to. Um... 

00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:46,919 [Robot]
What about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:53,500 [User]
That's difficult. That's really important still to tell the truth if possible. 

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,799 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? 

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:08,659 [User]
I generally prefer not to comment at all. I mean, if I have a negative opinion about someone's
appearance, I just don't make a comment. 

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,179 [Robot]
What are some situations where lying might be justified? 

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:48,359 [User]
Ooh, this is hard. Um, I have had a recent situation with my stepmother, who is gone, has gone into
a senior care facility, and her son insists on always telling her the truth. And I have had some
moments when I thought that we didn't need to tell her the whole truth about the situation. So I
guess when she was moving into the facility, not telling her every single detail about the move, for
me, it wasn't really a lie, it was an omission. So I guess- 

00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,839 [Robot]
What do you think about the idea of lying to protect someone from danger? 

00:01:51,839 --> 00:02:02,819 [User]
That's important. I think that's an im- that might be an important lie that you have to, that you
have to tell. 

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:08,099 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about the situation with your stepmother and how you handled it? 

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:31,759 [User]
I bowed to my brother's feelings, and my stepbrother, who is her son, um, she's my stepmother, he's
my stepbrother, he's her son. So, I let him make the final decision on everything he told her. And
I, and I think it turned out better that no one lied to her. She was told the truth. 

00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,319 [Robot]
That's a tough situation. How did you navigate your feelings while respecting your brother's
position? 

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:55,419 [User]
Well, I have known her for over 50 years. So, um, I did have some feelings about it, but ultimately,
it didn't hurt my feelings to tell the truth. There was- 

00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:58,019 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,899 [User]
Then the relationship is not strong enough to withstand the truth. 

00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:13,359 [Robot]
What if the relationship is important to you? Do you believe there are times when it might be better
to tell a small lie to protect it? 

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:22,399 [User]
I have done that in my life, so I can't say that I haven't. I just can't think of any specific
examples that I- 

00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:27,559 [Robot]
Is it okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:03:27,559 --> 00:04:09,999 [User]
I think it is okay to keep secrets, or I would say it's okay to keep your feelings to yourselves. I
think that that would be a more appropriate way to put it. Um, but I've never enjoyed secrets like
where you're gonna surprise someone uncomfortably. So I tend to, I tend to tell those secrets
instead of keeping them in. But I'm trying to think of a time when a secret is actually an
appropriate thing. Oh, well, when you're gonna give somebody some kind of joy that, you know, you
hope will bring them happiness. That's a secret. That's a good secret. Um, I don't- 

00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,519 [Robot]
What are some other situations where it might be difficult to decide whether to tell the truth or
not? 

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:51,139 [User]
Well, hurting someone's feeling is really important. Protecting a relationship is really important.
Um, but again, if a relationship relies... If a relationship is i- rests on dishonesty, then it's
not a good relationship. Um, on the other hand, if you tell a small lie, like, uh, I don't know,
please come at 5:00 instead of please come at 6:00 'cause you know they're always late, then I think
it's sort of harmless. You're just getting them to get there on time. So- 

00:04:51,139 --> 00:05:01,659 [Robot]
What, what if a friend confided in you with a secret and then authorities questioned you about it?
Would you feel compelled to tell the truth even if it meant betraying your friend's trust? 

00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:05,979 [User]
What kind of a secret are you talking about? 

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:17,139 [Robot]
I can see that these situations are really complex and can involve a lot of conflicting feelings.
What do you think about the idea of lying to authorities to protect a friend or loved one? 

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:51,199 [User]
Well, I don't have a high opinion very often of authorities. Um, it really depends on the situation
and depends on what kind of authority. But many authorities, uh, I, I don't have a horrible time
protecting someone by not fully, uh, telling everything about something, a situation. In other
words, I don't feel good about lying and telling something that's blatantly untrue, but I don't feel
too bad about withholding information. 

00:05:51,199 --> 00:06:04,879 [Robot]
That makes sense. Sometimes it's important to protect the ones we care about. Let's discuss when it
might be justified to lie in that context. For example, what do you think about situations where the
truth could put someone in danger? 

00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:10,559 [User]
I would try to avoid the situation. 

00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:21,299 [Robot]
What if you were in a situation where lying might be the only way to prevent someone from getting
hurt? Can you think of any examples where this could be justified? 

00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:35,239 [User]
I'm trying to think of an example. Um, I suppose if there's an abusive situation, you might lie to
someone to try to get them out of that abusive situation. 

00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:42,959 [Robot]
That's a tough situation to navigate. Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar
situation? What did you do? 

00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:54,219 [User]
I can't think of a time when I did face a similar situation. So I can't really answer that question
appropriately or fully. 

00:06:54,219 --> 00:07:07,999 [Robot]
That's okay. It's not always easy to think of specific examples. Let's talk about something else. In
what way do cultural differences impact what's considered acceptable in terms of lying or being
honest? 

00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:12,179 [User]
Oh, I think there's very big cultural differences. 

00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:18,859 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
