00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,579 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:06,719 [User]
Sure. 

00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:15,439 [Robot]
(clicks tongue) Have you ever faced a situation when telling the truth might damage a relationship?
What happened? 

00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:33,159 [User]
Yeah, definitely. Um, I think it happens a lot when you, you have a friend who might be doing
something that annoys you, but you don't want to say, uh, what it is 'cause they're your friend and
you don't want to hurt their feelings. But, uh... 

00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:38,739 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:48,139 [User]
(smacks lips) Uh, well, one basic situation that comes to my mind is, uh, when I... 

00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:54,099 [Robot]
Were you able to resolve the situation without hurting your friend's feelings or did the issue
linger? 

00:00:54,099 --> 00:01:16,119 [User]
Um, in the particular example I was going to tell you, uh, the situation w- was resolved 'cause it
was kind of a, a pretty simple annoyance. Uh, but definitely if the annoyance is, like, something a
bit more personal, then, uh, you probably need to treat the situation a bit more delicately. Uh, but
in my case, it was fine. 

00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:22,039 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,339 [User]
Um, what about it? 

00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:28,959 [Robot]
What do you think about lying to avoid doing something you don't want to do? 

00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:51,379 [User]
Uh, I think usually you should be honest. Um, but maybe, like, you need to lie if it's, uh, the only
way out of the situation, and if you told the truth, you would endanger yourself. But I guess that's
typically not the case, so you should usually be honest. 

00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:58,959 [Robot]
What's your opinion on keeping secrets? Do you think it's okay to keep certain things to yourself in
some situations? 

00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,519 [User]
(smacks lips) Um, oh, I think you should always tell people. Uh- 

00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,139 [Robot]
What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:18,919 [User]
(smacks lips) Uh, probably ones that don't really matter that much for, for the other person, uh- 

00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:26,859 [Robot]
What if keeping a secret could protect someone from danger? Do you think it's okay to lie in that
scenario? 

00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,499 [User]
Um, def- 

00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:36,559 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone from danger? Do you think it's justifiable in that case? 

00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:49,039 [User]
In the immediate term, I think if you have to lie to keep someone protected, then it's probably a
good thing to do. But in the long term, honesty is probab- 

00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:56,559 [Robot]
What about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds of lies are
beneficial or harmful? 

00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:16,379 [User]
Uh, I'm not really sure about that one. I haven't thought about that too much, 'cause as a kid, I
think I would have enjoyed those, uh, kind of fairy tales. But at the same time, as an adult, I also
wish that I would know the truth. Uh, but I don't know. 

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:30,759 [Robot]
It's interesting to think about the different perspectives on this matter. What about when lying
helps navigate cultural differences? For example, in a country where it's polite to say you enjoyed
a meal that you didn't, how would you handle that? 

00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:46,319 [User]
(smacks lips) Uh, if it, if in the context it doesn't really matter much that you tell the truth,
uh, then I think it's fine to, just to adapt to the culture, um, if, if the outcome doesn't really
matter. 

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:55,239 [Robot]
(clicks tongue) What about if you were to lie to authorities if your friend confided in you a secret
that could potentially lead to illegal activity? 

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:06,059 [User]
(smacks lips) Um, not so sure about that one. Uh, depends on what the, the thing is and how much I
understand it. 

00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:11,999 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:20,439 [User]
Uh, no, I can't really tell you about a similar situation. That's never really happened to me. 

00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:24,199 [Robot]
What do you think about lies as part of secret agents' jobs? 

00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:41,119 [User]
(smacks lips) Uh, I think it probably helps them fulfill their objectives. I don't know if it's
necessarily a good thing that they lie in those contexts, but I understand that it's necessary for
how they operate. 

00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:48,099 [Robot]
Have you ever had to consider lying to protect someone from danger in real life? How did you handle
the situation? 

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:58,719 [User]
Hm, at the moment, I can't really think of anything, any situation in particular where I had to lie
to protect a friend. 

00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:06,439 [Robot]
That makes sense. What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their
appearance? 

00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:30,459 [User]
Um, it depends, 'cause maybe commenting on their appearance, for example, if they have, like, food
on their face, uh, while eating a meal, maybe they would appreciate if you told them. But at the
same time, it's not nice to tell someone, uh, something negative about their appearance. So, it
really depends, uh, what you think they would think of you. 

00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:36,259 [Robot]
What do you think about situations where lying might be justified, like protecting someone from
danger? 

00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:57,379 [User]
Um, uh, as I said before, if, if you have to lie in the short term to protect someone, uh, then I
guess it's probably a good idea. Of course, it depends on the situation, but I think typically in
the long term, you could probably sort out, uh, the situation enough so that you don't need to lie
to protect anyone from danger. 

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:12,839 [Robot]
(clicks tongue) What about when someone lies to avoid doing something they don't want to do, like
telling someone they have plans when they actually don't? Do you think it's sometimes necessary in
those extreme situations, or is it better to be honest? 

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:26,699 [User]
Um, I don't really think that's such a, an extreme situation. I think in those situations, you
should probably just be honest. Of course it's not comfortable, um, but yeah, that's just how it is.


00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,899 [Robot]
What do you think about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep unimportant ones, or should everything
be shared openly? 

00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:52,619 [User]
(smacks lips) Uh, I think it depends on what the secret is. If the secret is something that would,
that the other person would benefit from hearing about, then it's probably good to tell them about
that. Otherwise, if it doesn't really matter for anyone, then it's probably... 

00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:59,599 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lying in professional contexts, such as in the workplace or between
business partners? 

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:19,099 [User]
(smacks lips) Um, well, I could see how in, um, in a business context maybe you get a question about
your personal life, and you don't really want to divulge those details. In that situation, I think
it's better to kind of, like, avoid the ques- 

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:26,219 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
