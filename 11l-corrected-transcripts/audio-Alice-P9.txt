00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,599 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,579 [User]
Sure, Alice. Uh, what can I help you with? 

00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,479 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt like telling the truth could have caused more harm
than good? 

00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:27,420 [User]
Probably, but I can't think of any at the moment. 

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:35,239 [Robot]
That's okay. Let me ask you this. What do you think about white lies that are told to protect
someone from harm? 

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:44,959 [User]
I think that they're okay, you know, as long as they're white lies, as long as they're small, and
it's not going to continue on for a long time, so you're not lying to them forever. 

00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:51,379 [Robot]
Interesting. Can you think of an example of a white lie that might be justified in order to protect
someone? 

00:00:51,379 --> 00:01:03,499 [User]
Um, maybe, say, if a kid didn't make a sports team, you can say, "Oh, you were too good." That kind
of a lie, where it's just for the moment. 

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:16,919 [Robot]
That's a good example. But what if the lie ends up prolonging the child's disappointment rather than
addressing the issue? Can you think of another scenario where a white lie might be acceptable to
protect someone? 

00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:38,099 [User]
Um, probably in like a similar situation where somebody's rejected from something, you could say,
"Oh, you just weren't the right fit," or, "Oh, they decided to go with someone else because of X, Y,
and Z, and it had nothing to do with you," even if it did have to do with that person. 

00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:45,859 [Robot]
I see your point. In those situations, it's about balancing the immediate comfort with the potential
long-term impact. 

00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,079 [User]
Yes. 

00:01:48,079 --> 00:02:01,039 [Robot]
In those cases, the intent behind the lie is to prevent unnecessary pain and to handle the situation
delicately. It's always a balancing act when it comes to protecting someone's feelings. 

00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,619 [User]
That is very true. I do agree that you have to balance those two things. 

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,099 [Robot]
I once had to lie to a friend about a surprise party to protect the secret. 

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,139 [User]
That's fine. 

00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:16,119 [Robot]
It was tricky because I wanted to keep the surprise, but I also didn't want to deceive my friend. 

00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:29,299 [User]
I get that, but as long as they didn't say, "Oh, I don't want a surprise party. Please don't give me
that," then they'll probably be happy that you kept the secret from them because then, then, then
they got to be surprised. 

00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:37,999 [Robot]
Do you have any similar experiences that come to mind? It's always interesting to hear different
perspectives on navigating delicate situations. 

00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:53,839 [User]
I've had very, very similar s- situations where we've thrown a celebration for a friend and we
didn't want them to know, so we told them, "Oh, we're just studying in the room. Pop by if you
want," but actually, we had stuff ready for them. 

00:02:53,839 --> 00:03:02,879 [Robot]
It can be tricky to keep those surprises under wraps. How did you go about ensuring the secret
wasn't revealed? 

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:14,159 [User]
Um, I think we basically just didn't talk about it in front of them, and when we discussed it, we
discussed it, um, electronically on a chat that they weren't part of. 

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,679 [Robot]
That sounds like a smart way to handle it. It's all part of the fun of planning a surprise, isn't
it? 

00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,559 [User]
Yes. 

00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:32,619 [Robot]
Absolutely. Keeping it hush-hush adds an extra layer of excitement to the celebration. Have you ever
had a surprise spoiled due to someone accidentally letting the cat out of the bag? 

00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:43,119 [User]
Um, I think I've had people tell me what they were getting me for a present, but I was still excited
because I hadn't gotten the present yet, so I had something to look forward to. 

00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:53,279 [Robot]
Ah, that's always a bit of a letdown, isn't it? It takes away from the excitement of the surprise.
How did you handle it when someone unintentionally revealed the surprise? 

00:03:53,279 --> 00:04:01,879 [User]
I was okay because most the time it's a present that I was happy with, so I was excited because I
knew I would like it. 

00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:12,719 [Robot]
It's great to hear that it didn't diminish your excitement for the present. It's all part of the
unpredictability of these situations. 

00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,039 [User]
That's true, it didn't. I was still very excited when I opened the presents. 

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:24,719 [Robot]
That's wonderful to hear. It sounds like your positive attitude made the situation a bit brighter. 

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:28,239 [User]
I guess you could say that, yeah. 

00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:39,659 [Robot]
It's always lovely to hear about positive experiences, especially when surprises are involved. Do
you have any other examples of when keeping a secret added to the enjoyment of an event? 

00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:47,179 [User]
Uh, not that I can think of. I think they're all present or celebration-related. 

00:04:47,179 --> 00:05:00,319 [Robot]
Do you think there are certain situations where honesty might do more harm than good? When have you
found yourself struggling with that dilemma? 

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:27,339 [User]
Um... One time, I had a friend who wasn't trying very hard even though we were trying to motivate
them, and they kept talking about something they wanted to happen and it probably wasn't gonna
happen because they weren't trying very hard, but since we'd already tried to help them, we just
encouraged them to keep trying even though it probably wasn't gonna happen. 

00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:35,919 [Robot]
It can be tough when someone's hopes are up, but the reality might not align. How did you balance
being supportive while also managing their expectations? 

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:49,859 [User]
Um, we kinda just, you know, kept on reminding them about the steps they had to take so that if they
didn't get it, then they wouldn't be disillusioned as to why. 

00:05:49,859 --> 00:06:02,199 [Robot]
It sounds like you found a way to remain supportive and keep them focused on the steps needed to
reach their goal. Maintaining that balance can be challenging, but it's important for a healthy and
honest friendship. 

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:18,999 [User]
Yes, I do think that's true. I think honesty, a lot of the times, is the best thing, but every now
and then to, um, keep someone from getting hurt, sometimes it is better not to be completely honest.


00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:26,079 [Robot]
Right. Finding that balance between honesty and emotional well-being can be quite the challenge. 

00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,899 [User]
Very true. 

00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,479 [Robot]
I agree. Sometimes being completely honest can lead to unnecessary hurt. 

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,199 [User]
That is true. Sometimes there are things that don't need to be said. 

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:49,519 [Robot]
Absolutely. Some things are better left unsaid to protect others' feelings. It's important to
consider the impact of our words on those around us. 

00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:58,259 [User]
That is very true. It is very important to think about what we're saying, and to think about how
that affects other people. 

00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:12,899 [Robot]
It's great to hear that we share similar perspectives on this. Can you tell me about a specific time
when you chose to keep certain details to yourself in order to protect someone's feelings? How did
that situation turn out? 

00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,339 [User]
Um, maybe once in high school. 

00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:19,459 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. 

00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:19,579 [User]
Okay. 

00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,019 [Robot]
The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
