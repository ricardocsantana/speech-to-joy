00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:01,079 [User]
... people lie, save a bunch of lives. 

00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,319 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,319 [User]
I might be able to help you out. 

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,979 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lying? Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation?
What did you do? 

00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:25,920 [User]
It's hard to think of an example except for maybe trivial ones where my daughter asked me- 

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,719 [Robot]
What about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:39,520 [User]
Yeah. Like, my daughter might ask me when she was a teenager about how she looked in some kind of
clothing and I thought it looked terrible. 

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,399 [Robot]
How did you handle those conversations with your daughter? And how did it turn out? 

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:56,180 [User]
Um, I told her something looked fine when it d- didn't look fine because I wanted her to be okay
and... 

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:08,859 [Robot]
It sounds like you wanted to protect your daughter's feelings. What kinds of situations besides
appearance do you think would justify lying to protect someone's feelings? 

00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:12,259 [User]
Um, hmm. 

00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:19,479 [Robot]
What about situations where someone's safety is at risk? Have you ever lied or kept a secret to
protect (air clicks) 

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,499 [User]
Um, I can't remember a situation where I lied to keep someone safe, but I would do that. 

00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:34,279 [Robot]
What about when someone confides in you about a secret? Is it okay to keep that secret even if it
involves not telling the truth to someone else? 

00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:40,299 [User]
I'm very good at keeping secrets. I've kept secrets that maybe I shouldn't have kept. 

00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:50,319 [Robot]
It's important to keep the trust of those who confide in us. Can you tell me more about a time when
you found it challenging to keep a secret? 

00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,339 [User]
Um... (sighs) 

00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:59,759 [Robot]
Can you tell me how you navigated the situation where you found it challenging to keep a secret? 

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,959 [User]
I think I just, uh, didn't tell people. 

00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:13,579 [Robot]
What about lying to authorities? Would you lie to authorities if you were asked about a secret
someone confided in you? 

00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:18,159 [User]
Probably not. 

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,839 [Robot]
What about professional lying? For example, secret agents lie as part of their jobs. What do you
think about that? 

00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:33,219 [User]
I think that would be a very useful talent. I don't have that, but it sounds like a good talent. 

00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:38,019 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on lying to avoid doing something you don't want to do? 

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:45,239 [User]
Um, I think that's stupid. I think you should, um, be more truthful about why you don't wanna do it.


00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,679 [Robot]
How do you feel about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds of
lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:59,719 [User]
I think Santa Claus in the lo- uh, in, uh, in the long run is beneficial. 

00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:06,479 [Robot]
Do you think there are other situations where lying might be justified or not justified? 

00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,899 [User]
Um, hmm. Uh... 

00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:19,219 [Robot]
What about cultural differences? For example, if you're in a country where it's polite to say you
enjoyed a meal that you didn't, how would you handle that? 

00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:25,379 [User]
Um, yeah. I'd probably lie and say I enjoyed it. 

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:32,319 [Robot]
Can you think of any other instances where lying might be necessary or situations where it would be
better to be honest? 

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:44,759 [User]
Um, well, I think lying is better to get you out the door faster if you wanna be... Finish something
and it helps to lie to g- going. Um... 

00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:53,239 [Robot]
What about situations where honesty might have a positive impact? Can you think of a time when being
honest improved a situation or relationship? 

00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:03,179 [User]
Yes. I honestly told my boss I could not work full-time because I would be sick if I did and then it
helped me get a part-time job. They were... They wanted me to work full-time. 

00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:12,819 [Robot]
It sounds like your honesty with your boss had a positive impact on your work situation. Can you
tell me more about that? What happened after you shared your concerns with your boss? 

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:23,819 [User]
Uh, I was allowed to work part-time and then I felt a lot better in my life. Instead of I could have
chosen to lie and say that I was, um, you know, sick or something else, but- 

00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,899 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,859 [User]
You mean similar to my job? I have, um... 

00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:38,439 [Robot]
Can you think of any other situations where being honest has positively impacted your relationships
or life? 

00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:50,539 [User]
Yeah. I think I have better friendships if I can just tell my friend that I'm too tired to meet
today instead of saying that, "Oh, I'm busy." Lying and saying I'm busy. Then I... If I have a real
friend, they'll- 

00:04:50,539 --> 00:05:01,979 [Robot]
It sounds like honesty is important to you in maintaining relationships and making decisions about
your work and personal life. Can you share more about how honesty helps you in those situations? 

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:15,599 [User]
Um, it's better to... It's easier to be honest now that I'm older. It was... It was harder when I
was younger as far as these social situations because now I just don't care so mu- I don't, um, give
an, a fuck, if I can say that. 

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:26,539 [Robot]
It seems like honesty has become a valuable tool in managing your relationships and work. Can you
think of any other situations where being honest has been helpful? 

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,559 [User]
Um... (sighs) 

00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:38,859 [Robot]
What about when honesty might have caused challenges in your relationships or work? Can you think of
a time when being honest led to difficulties? 

00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:42,319 [User]
Um, sure. I guess I, sometimes- 

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:51,339 [Robot]
How do you handle situations where being honest might have caused challenges in your relationships
or work? Can you think of a specific scenario where honesty led to difficulties? 

00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:59,839 [User]
Um, not really 'cause I'm, I'm... I really try to avoid confrontation and conflict so, maybe I'm not
honest in that way. 

00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:06,199 [Robot]
Have you ever thought about how avoiding confrontation and conflict might affect your ability to be
honest in certain situations? 

00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,839 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:15,759 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you felt that avoiding confrontation and conflict led you to be
less honest in a situation? 

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:29,499 [User]
Well, like, my boss asked me if there was anyone at my workplace I didn't wa- get along with and I
just said I got along with everybody but... Which is kind of true, but if, uh, also I thought
afterwards that there were people that would- 

00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:37,519 [Robot]
It sounds like finding a balance between honesty and avoiding conflict can be challenging. Can you
think of a time where (foreign language) 

00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:43,979 [User]
Um, I didn't understand that. I think you're speaking another language. Could you try that in
English? 

00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:55,339 [Robot]
I'm sorry for the confusion. Can you think of a time when you managed to navigate a situation at
work or in your personal life by finding a balance between being honest and avoiding conflict? 

00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:00,399 [User]
Uh, no. But I think it was... It's, um, I think I li- 

00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,179 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. 

00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:02,799 [User]
I think I hos- 

00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:07,259 [Robot]
The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
