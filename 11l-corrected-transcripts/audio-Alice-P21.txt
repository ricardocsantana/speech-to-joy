00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:05,299 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,759 [User]
Sure thing. 

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,159 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:20,319 [User]
Ooh, that is a good question. Um... 

00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:24,579 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:28,779 [User]
What did I do? I think I just faced it head-on. 

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:33,159 [Robot]
Did you decide to tell the truth or did you think a little white lie might be a better option? 

00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,239 [User]
Truth. 

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,200 [Robot]
How did that turn out? 

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,919 [User]
Better. Better than I think a white lie would. 

00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:45,479 [Robot]
Sometimes honesty makes a relationship stronger, right? 

00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,899 [User]
Yes. 

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,979 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? 

00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,919 [User]
Then maybe a white lie is better. 

00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:06,559 [Robot]
So, in that case, you think a little white lie might be justified to spare someone's feelings,
right? 

00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:11,239 [User]
Depends on the situation, but yes. 

00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,659 [Robot]
What are some situations where lying might be justified? 

00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:28,179 [User]
Um, like the one that you just said about someone's appearance because it might not be the full
truth that I have that opinion. It just might be my truth, not everyone else's truth. 

00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:40,099 [Robot]
I understand. It's important to consider different perspectives and the impact our words can have on
others. Is there another example you can think of where lying might be justified? 

00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:49,999 [User]
Ooh, I think once again, I think it has to do with the fact that I know that it's my opinion so
maybe I need to just keep it to myself. 

00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:56,479 [Robot]
What about situations where lying is to protect someone from danger? Do you think that could be
justified? 

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:04,159 [User]
Yes and no. That's a- that's a hard one. 

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,999 [Robot]
It's definitely a difficult balance to strike. Have you ever been in a situation where protecting
someone meant lying? 

00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,839 [User]
No, I don't believe so. No, I don't think I have. 

00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:27,939 [Robot]
It's good to hear that you value honesty. Let's shift to another situation. What if lying is to keep
a secret? Do you think it could be justified in those cases? 

00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:38,639 [User]
It depends on what it is. It could be a surprise party and it's a secret and not telling the truth.
But no, if it's something big and someone needs to know about it, I wouldn't. 

00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:50,819 [Robot]
It sounds like you believe in the importance of honesty, especially in building and maintaining
strong relationships. Can you think of another situation where keeping a secret may or may not be
justified? 

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:50,919 [User]
Um... No. 

00:02:50,919 --> 00:03:10,579 [Robot]
How about cultural differences? Sometimes lying helps navigate cultural differences. For example, if
you're in a country where it's polite to say you enjoy a male shock, you'd ink he will like you. 

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:17,399 [User]
Yes. Maybe. 

00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:27,279 [Robot]
Has being in a situation like that ever made you question the value of honesty or made you consider
what is more important, preserving cultural norms or being completely truthful? 

00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:37,939 [User]
I think being contr- completely truthful, but being respectful in the sense that you can have a
conversation about it instead of having to lie or go around it. 

00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:54,059 [Robot]
That's a wise approach. It's important to respect cultural norms while still being true to yourself.
Can you think of another example where cultural differences might challenge the idea of honesty? 

00:03:54,059 --> 00:04:01,799 [User]
Yeah, I think it's hard. I think it's when someone has an- very diverse, uh, cultural differences. 

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:13,859 [Robot]
Yeah. Cultural differences can definitely make things tricky. It can be challenging when different
cultures have different expectations for honesty. Can you share a specific example that comes to
mind? 

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:31,939 [User]
Ooh. Um, I'm American so I think Americans tend to be more brutally honest than other cultures, for
example. So then maybe if I have a conversation with another person who is from a different culture,
as a Swede, might be less, uh, open to having those conversations. So yes. 

00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:45,879 [Robot]
I see what you mean. It can be tough to navigate those differences in communication styles. Can you
think of a specific situation where this cultural contrast caused a difficulty in being honest? 

00:04:45,879 --> 00:05:00,239 [User]
Um, yes. I think politically, Americans are very vocal about politics and so I might be more vocal
about politics than, uh, my Swedish friends, for example. They tend to try to stray away from
discussing politics. 

00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:11,539 [Robot]
That makes sense. It's important to be mindful of those differences. Have you found a way to
navigate political discussions with friends from different cultural backgrounds? 

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:26,659 [User]
Yes. Um, I try to keep an open mind and I'm curious and I like to know more about how they're
thinking about certain things, but I do want to get that back as well. So I make sure that that
person also is open to having those conversations. 

00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:36,579 [Robot]
It sounds like you found a good balance in your conversations. Do you think these cultural
differences impact the way you approach honesty in other areas of your life? 

00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:50,919 [User]
No. I, I don't think so. I still think that I keep honesty close to heart even though it might be
more difficult to have conversations around culture. I still think it's very important to be honest.


00:05:50,919 --> 00:06:04,779 [Robot]
It's great to hear that honesty is important to you, even when navigating cultural differences. Can
you think of another instance where being open and honest became a challenge due to specific
circumstances? 

00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:19,739 [User]
Yeah. I think it's, it's difficult when you're having a conversation with someone who has incredibly
different opinions to you, um, and you get a sort of a, um, crossroad. 

00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:31,459 [Robot]
It can be really tough to stay open and honest when you're discussing sensitive topics with someone
who holds very different opinions. Can you tell me about a specific situation where this become a
challenge for you? 

00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:53,399 [User]
I think having a conversation with a friend of how she grew up and how she values certain things
became a difficult conversation to have when I might have a very different opinion to that. But I'd
like to have the conversation and I want to know more of why that is, and then also be open to her
and yeah. 

00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:06,719 [Robot]
It sounds like it's important for you to understand and have empathy for different perspectives,
even when it's challenging. Can you share a specific example of a time when this openness helped
bridge a gap in understanding with your friend? 

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:29,979 [User]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I had difficult conversation with, uh, a friend regarding her political views
and, uh, we somehow were able to have a conversation about my views as well, um, and it didn't turn
into a fight or into a large argument or conversation. We just sort of respected each other's
opinions and then moved on. 

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:36,519 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
