00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,900 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,019 [User]
Shoot. 

00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,340 [Robot]
What do you think about the idea of lying to protect someone else? 

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,759 [User]
Uh, sometimes you gotta do it. 

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,840 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:37,059 [User]
Mmm... Mmm, my friend is... Started dating someone a while ago, but she didn't want to tell our
whole friend group, so I... 

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,860 [Robot]
How did you navigate that situation? 

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:51,919 [User]
Kind of told, like, white lies to protect her secret, because I felt like it was her choice when to
tell other people about her relationship and, um... 

00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:57,459 [Robot]
Do you think it's okay to keep a secret to protect someone's privacy, even if it involves telling
lies? 

00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:21,139 [User]
I mean, yeah, sure. I- I think you can't look at it so black and white, because there's, like, lies
of different magnitude. You know, if- if I'm just like, "Oh, you know, my friend is, uh, having a
meal with a friend," as opposed to, like, "Having a meal with her boyfriend," like, I don't think
anyone really cares or it doesn't- doesn't hurt anybody, you know? Like... 

00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:26,559 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a time when that
might happen? 

00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:53,179 [User]
Yeah, like in that setting I was talking about, like, if everyone had known about her relationship
immediately when they were still getting to know each other, like, maybe, um, it would have... It
would have been too much pressure and maybe the relationship wouldn't have worked out, but because
they were able to reduce the amount of outside, you know, pressure by keeping it just to themselves,
uh, it was, um, yeah. 

00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:53,860 [Robot]
How'd- 

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,719 [User]
So far it's worked out and it's a- a better outcome, I think. 

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:04,439 [Robot]
What if keeping the truth to yourself might help maintain trust in the relationship, even if it
involves a little white lie? 

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:15,499 [User]
I mean, again, it depends on the magnitude. A small white lie, s- sure, but if you're like, "I
cheated on someone and I'm not gonna tell them so they trust me," like, that would be, I think,
unacceptable. 

00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,919 [Robot]
I see. So the scale of the lie matters. 

00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,979 [User]
Yeah. Of course. 

00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,799 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt like telling the truth might hurt someone's
feelings? So- 

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,619 [User]
Oh, all the time. 

00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:42,239 [Robot]
Can you give me an example of a time when telling the truth might have hurt someone's feelings,
and... Can you give me an example of a time when telling the truth might have hurt someone's
feelings? And how did you handle it? 

00:02:42,239 --> 00:03:17,239 [User]
Okay. One thing I've been thinking about lately is, like, I have different fashion sense from my
friends and, you know, everyone has their own unique, individual style, but sometimes they wear
things and I'm like, "I don't think it's flattering on them," but it makes them feel good. I'm not
gonna be like, "That looks ugly on you," because that would just be rude and unhelpful, you know?
Unless they specifically ask me, like, uh, you know, "Do you like this outfit?" And then I would be
like, "Oh, you know, it's okay." And I wouldn't be like, "It's horrible," you know? Because still,
it's- it's just, it's not that important to be truthful. 

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,619 [Robot]
That sounds tough. How do you balance being honest with not hurting their feelings? 

00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:34,899 [User]
I mean, just, like, practice, you know. Uh, it's- it's not that bad, like, once you... It's not,
it's not difficult once you become accustomed to it, like... 

00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:39,399 [Robot]
That makes sense. It's important to consider how our words could impact others. 

00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,459 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:47,819 [Robot]
Can you think of a situation where lying might be justified to protect someone from danger? 

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,759 [User]
Protect someone from danger? What kind of danger? 

00:03:50,759 --> 00:04:04,659 [Robot]
It could be someone's safety, like a friend asking you to cover for them when they are escaping a
potentially dangerous situation. Can you think of a time when lying might be justified to protect
someone from danger? 

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,399 [User]
Sure, yeah. Lots of situations. 

00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:13,159 [Robot]
In what situations do you think it's justifiable to lie to protect someone from danger? 

00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:27,319 [User]
Like the one you just suggested. If someone, uh, you said is escaping a bad situation. Maybe they
have, like, an abusive partner and then you, you know, tell some lies so that they can escape that
relationship or something like... 

00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:34,079 [Robot]
What about situations where lying is part of a job, like a secret agent who needs to lie as part of
their job? 

00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,139 [User]
Sure. 

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,139 [Robot]
What do you think about that? 

00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,959 [User]
I think secret agents are cool. Uh, yeah. It's just part of their job sometimes. 

00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:49,779 [Robot]
Sometimes lying helps navigate cultural differences. For example, if you're in a country where it's
polite to say you enjoyed a meal that you didn't, how would you handle that? 

00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:56,159 [User]
I'd probably say I enjoyed the meal. Like... (laughs) Trying to make friends, you know. 

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,119 [Robot]
Have you ever had to lie to avoid doing something you didn't want to do? 

00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:10,339 [User]
Probably, yeah. Like every time my mom asked me to take the dog for a walk and I was like, "Mm, I'm
tired." (laughs) You know? 

00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:16,079 [Robot]
Is it okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:26,079 [User]
I mean, I'm not about to tell you all my secrets, but, uh, but yeah. Of course it's okay. Everyone
has things they wanna keep private. Of course. Yeah. 

00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:33,559 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds
of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:51,479 [User]
I mean, I think that it's fun to have, like, sort of imaginary, like, magical beings like Santa
Claus. I'm a Jew, so, uh, I don't have a lot of intimate experience with the Santa Claus lie, but,
um... 

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,179 [Robot]
How do you feel about telling children the truth about difficult topics, like death or illness? 

00:05:56,179 --> 00:06:17,679 [User]
Uh, I think we should try. Like, I- I think it's- it's good to, like, have make-believe with kids,
but, like, tell them it's make-believe, but, you know, still engage in it. Uh, but then also I think
we should tell kids the truth when we can, like, um, i- in a gentle, kind way that's, like, age
appropriate, but, like, I- I think kids should know what's going on. 

00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:23,819 [Robot]
How about lying to authorities? Would you lie to authorities if your friend confided in you a
secret? 

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:35,819 [User]
I mean, it depends on the secret. Um, so sometimes the law is not on the morally correct side of
things, you know? Like, the law isn't the utmost authority. 

00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:43,499 [Robot]
What do you think about lying in a professional setting, like embellishing a resume or during a job
interview? 

00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:50,179 [User]
I mean, it depends. If... This is- it's too big a question. Like, what do you mean? 

00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,899 [Robot]
What about lying to authorities? Like- 

00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,439 [User]
Oh, you already asked me that. 

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,959 [Robot]
Apologies for the repetition. What are some other situations where lying might be justified or not
justified, in your opinion? 

00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,019 [User]
Um, why don't you give me some examples and I could tell you what I think? 

00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:12,659 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. 

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,019 [User]
Okay. 

00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:14,479 [Robot]
Hope you have a truly great day.
