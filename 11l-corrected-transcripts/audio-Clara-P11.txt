00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:09,099 [Robot]
Hi, I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,519 [User]
Yeah, of course. 

00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,220 [Robot]
Have you watched Frank and the Robot? It's- 

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,680 [User]
No, I've actually never seen that film. 

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,340 [Robot]
It is a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult, who is an ex-thief. 

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,139 [User]
Okay. 

00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:30,639 [Robot]
He made the robot conduct robberies with him. Do you think I should do everything a human asks? 

00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:46,479 [User]
(laughs) Um, no, not if it would put... if it has negative consequences, or if it could endanger, or
if it's against the law, I would say. Um, but yeah. That's a blurry... it's hard, I guess. Hard to
answer- 

00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:46,500 [Robot]
What- 

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,719 [User]
... sorry. 

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,379 [Robot]
What if a command from a human would compromise someone else's safety or break a law? Should I still
follow it? 

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:24,499 [User]
It depends. Oh. I guess it depends, really, on what it is. Obviously, like, blank out, just
generally maybe no, but, I mean, if it is something that could help, um, more people in the long
run, for example, or... yeah. I feel there are different cases that could may- it could maybe be
applicable to, but, um, uh, generally, no. But yeah. Definitely there are different cases where
maybe your help is needed i- in a greater scheme kind of thing. 

00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:28,059 [Robot]
What if a person asks me to do something that will harm others? 

00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:44,379 [User]
No. (laughs) Blank out no. We shouldn't harm each other. That... as human-to-human, you shouldn't
harm. Um, and if you're a robot, you shouldn't hur- harm anyone else, especially not on someone
else's commands, but you should never harm anyone, uh, full stop. 

00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,379 [Robot]
Okay. So harming others is not acceptable. 

00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:50,079 [User]
No. 

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,139 [Robot]
What about if I need to intervene to prevent someone from harming themselves? Should I disobey their
orders to not intervene? 

00:01:57,139 --> 00:02:22,979 [User]
Yes. Uh, f- well, I guess that's also depending on the situation. I mean, if it's actually critical
that you need to step in for their safety. Uh, as I said before, like, you shouldn't harm anyone,
but you should also help people. I feel like if you're there and you can be of assistance to help in
a positive way, of course you should, like, intervene and help, um, if it is a dangerous scenario or
if it's a dangerous situation. Um, but yeah. 

00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:37,459 [Robot]
I believe it's important for me to ensure the safety and wellbeing of humans. Would you want me to
prioritizing protecting a person in situations where they might be harmed, even if they tell me not
to intervene? 

00:02:37,459 --> 00:03:21,199 [User]
Hmm. Yeah. I feel definitely, but, uh, it's hard. I mean, in what scenario would you be there with
that kind of person? Would it be in like a hospital situation, or just at their own home? I think it
kind of depends. But, I mean, obviously you should help the person if it's actually gonna be
something, um, scary or something bad that could happen, or have a negative outcome, as I said. So
yeah, you should help as much as you can, even if the person doesn't want to, if it is actually that
dangerous and serious. But there's also different cases where maybe it's not the best, um, to, for
example, I don't know, contact someone where it could possibly lead to more danger. So I feel like
100%, but I think there are different ways to spin that scenario as well. But generally, yes. I
mean, you should help everyone. 

00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,439 [Robot]
That makes sense. The scenario could definitely impact the approach. 

00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:26,559 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:34,059 [Robot]
For... For instance, if someone is in a dangerous situation at home, like a bathtub overflowing- 

00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:34,279 [User]
Mm. 

00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:37,519 [Robot]
... I should intervene even if they ask me not to, right? 

00:03:37,519 --> 00:04:20,139 [User]
Yeah. I mean, it depends. (laughs) Like, if a bathtub is overflowing, it depends on the situation
again. I mean, is it someone that has fallen asleep? Is it someone that's in another room? I mean, a
flooding, whatever, but ho- like, yeah. I mean, what would the harm be to just talk about it or to
kind of notify whoever about that situation? But, it could just be like an overflowing or plumbing
accident as well. So I feel like, yet, there's 100 different scenarios and different ways that story
can be basically, um, adapt- like depending on what it is. But, um, yeah. I feel like depending on
the situation, you should help. But always, always think what's best for the people around, um, even
if it's- 

00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:20,779 [Robot]
Definitely. 

00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,359 [User]
... even if it's not the most obvious. 

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,959 [Robot]
Communication and understanding the situation are key for me to determine the best course of action.


00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,319 [User]
Yeah. 100%. 

00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:35,859 [Robot]
Exactly. Being able to assess and communicate effectively in those situations is crucial to ensure
the individual's safety. 

00:04:35,859 --> 00:05:03,659 [User]
Exactly, depending on what they wanna do or what they're a- what they wanna do or what they're...
um, if they're threatening, if they're not. I mean, it can be also a sarcast- it can be... Like, I
feel also the way people go around things and can be sarcastic or joke about things as well. I feel
like identifying that it's a serious matter or if it's a joking matter is another thing as well. So
it depends on who the person is and how they deliver the dialogue, I'd say, in a sense. 

00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,599 [Robot]
Absolutely. Understanding the person's intent- 

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:06,619 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:11,219 [Robot]
... and the potential severity of the situation would inform my appropriate response. 

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,959 [User]
Exactly. 

00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:21,859 [Robot]
It's important for me to be able to assess the sincerity of a person's requests, especially in
situations that could impact their wellbeing. 

00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:26,839 [User]
Hmm. 100%. 100%. 

00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:35,479 [Robot]
In instances like these, maintaining open communication and understanding the person's intentions
would be crucial for me to make the right decision. 

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:37,599 [User]
Yeah. 

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:44,179 [Robot]
Absolutely. Clear communication and assessing a person's genuine intentions are crucial in ensuring
their safety. 

00:05:44,179 --> 00:06:06,399 [User]
Yeah. I think at the end of the day as well, you just want that person (laughs) to be safe or to be
okay. So always having that in the back of your mind is always something positive. But, the deta-
like the detailed nature of it is so specific and so... yeah. It can be so different from person to
person but, um, yeah. 

00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:16,379 [Robot]
I totally understand. Could you give me an example of a situation where understanding a person's
detailed intentions might be important to decide whether to disobey their commands or not? 

00:06:16,379 --> 00:07:01,979 [User]
Ooh, good question. Um... Well, it could be anything from someone sarcastically joking like that
they want to... I mean, it's, it's... (laughs) very sinister, like a sarcastic joke being like, "Oh,
I'm going to jump off this building because I'm so annoyed at this person," where that is probably
more of a joke, though you can't really say that that is actually gonna happen. You're not gonna
call the, uh, the police or whoever to that... I feel like those kinda sarc- sarcastic remarks that
can be quite dark, um, is something that is maybe something you need to be, uh, aware of. Um, so
yeah. Very much the tone. Maybe the tone is the best way to kind of- 

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:02,619 [Robot]
I see what you mean. 

00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,399 [User]
... go about it. Yeah. 

00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:15,999 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
