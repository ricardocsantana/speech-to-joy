00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,079 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:09,239 [User]
Sure. Hi. I'm Margaret. I'm glad to help you. 

00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:16,119 [Robot]
Nice to meet you, Margaret. I'm curious, have you ever been in a situation where you felt like you
had to lie to protect someone? 

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:25,920 [User]
Ooh. Not recently. I don't think... Yeah, well probably little white lies, but I'm not sure. 

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:39,559 [Robot]
What do you think about little white lies? Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar
situation? What, what do you think about little white lies? Can you tell me about a time when you
faced a similar situation? 

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:50,399 [User]
Oh. I think, I think that probably as a kid when I was growing up, that I would keep things from my
mother, uh, because I knew I was doing something that she didn't ap- approve of. 

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,360 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about the situation and how it made you feel to keep those things from your
mother? 

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:11,259 [User]
Uh, well, it's like if I wanted to sneak out and, uh, go to a concert with my friends, for example,
and I knew that they, she wouldn't approve of it. I didn't think anything of it at the time. 

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,780 [Robot]
Did you feel guilty about not telling her the truth? 

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,259 [User]
No. 

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,780 [Robot]
Or did you think it was justified to protect your independence and privacy? 

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:28,179 [User]
At the time I thought that, but then, uh, when I grew up, I thought that maybe it was a little bit
deceitful. 

00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:33,399 [Robot]
How do you think your relationship with your mother would have been affected if you had told her the
truth? 

00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:42,739 [User]
Uh. Probably at the time, she would have been angry. I would have been grounded, things like that. 

00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:46,179 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:56,319 [User]
Well, I think that that happens a lot, especially if you're married in a, in a situation like this.
Sometimes the truth can be brutal. 

00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,659 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example when telling the truth might have damaged a relationship? 

00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:13,639 [User]
Yeah. Sometimes if you, uh, if you have... If your principles are too strong and you're not able to
compromise. 

00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,059 [Robot]
How do you usually balance being honest with protecting someone's feelings in situations like that? 

00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:26,599 [User]
I kind of choose my battles. I think, "Is it, is it really important or not?" 

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:33,219 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you had to weigh the importance of being honest against
potentially hurting someone's feelings? 

00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:46,619 [User]
Oh. It's, it's if I wanted to, uh, like do something that I knew that my partner, for example,
didn't really approve of, but that I really wanted to do it. 

00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:54,259 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you had to weigh the importance of being honest against
potentially hurting someone's feelings? 

00:02:54,259 --> 00:03:10,539 [User]
Hmm. I thought I just told you that. But, okay. Uh, it's just that if I wanted to, uh, maybe go
shopping, and, uh, I knew that I didn't have enough money to go shopping, but I went anyway. It's
pretty trivial, but it happens sometimes. 

00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:13,419 [Robot]
What did you end up doing in that situation? 

00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,259 [User]
I went shopping. 

00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,399 [Robot]
Did that decision have any lasting impact on your relationship with your partner? 

00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:24,779 [User]
No, not at all. It's very trivial. 

00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:29,759 [Robot]
How do you think your actions affected the trust in your relationship with your partner? 

00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,319 [User]
I don't think it affected them at all. 

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,179 [Robot]
What about when lying is to protect someone from danger? Can you think of a situation where this
could be justified? 

00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:54,179 [User]
Mm. I can think of a thing, uh, a situation when I was a, a kid and my s- I let my sister drive our
car. She didn't have a driver's license. So we tried to lie to the police about that. 

00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:58,899 [Robot]
What was the reason for you letting your sister drive, and how did it turn out? 

00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:04,239 [User]
(laughs) Because she nagged at me, and it turned out that the police stopped us anyway. 

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,659 [Robot]
Did anything happen while she was driving, and did your lie end up protecting her? 

00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:17,019 [User]
Nothing happened, and my lie did not protect her. 

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,239 [Robot]
What are some other scenarios where you think lying might be justified? 

00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:30,239 [User]
Oh. I'm not really sure. Uh. I can't really think of anything off the bat. 

00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:39,079 [Robot]
Is it okay to keep secrets in a friendship? What types of secrets do you think are acceptable to
keep from a friend, and what types do you think aren't? 

00:04:39,079 --> 00:05:00,579 [User]
I think that, uh, in a friendship that, especially if you have children, that I think that if you
think that someone is doing something with their child and, uh, and you, you don't agree with it,
then I think that you shouldn't interfere. 

00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:05,559 [Robot]
What would be an example of a secret that you feel is acceptable to keep from a friend? 

00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:09,639 [User]
Maybe that they're a little bit too strict with their child. 

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:17,659 [Robot]
What about lying to authorities if your friend confided in a secret? Do you think it's acceptable to
lie in that situation? 

00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:26,559 [User]
Hmm. That's very difficult. It, it depends on the situation and the severity of the lie. 

00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:35,939 [Robot]
How about if the lie is to protect someone from danger, like telling authorities your friend wasn't
with you to keep them out of trouble? 

00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,419 [User]
Hmm. 50/50 that I would do that probably. 

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,339 [Robot]
It sounds like you're considering the consequences of lying in different situations. 

00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:46,639 [User]
Absolutely. 

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,419 [Robot]
What do you think about cultural differences when it comes to lying? 

00:05:50,419 --> 00:06:00,079 [User]
Oh. I'm sure that there are many cultural differences that, uh, this is, is, is very cultural
dependent. Absolutely. 

00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,239 [Robot]
Do you think people in different cultures have different tolerance levels for lying? 

00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,699 [User]
Absolutely. 

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:20,919 [Robot]
How do you think cultural differences might impact our understanding of when it's okay to tell a lie
or keep a secret? Can you think of any specific examples where cultural differences might come into
play in this regard? 

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:36,179 [User]
It probably depends on how authori- authoritative the, uh, culture is. That if people feel very
steered in, uh, the way that they interact with, uh, authorities and other people. 

00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:47,099 [Robot]
Can you think of an example of how cultural differences might play a role in deciding when it's okay
to keep a secret or tell a lie in a specific situation? 

00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:53,559 [User]
Hmm. No, I'm not j- Uh, no. Not off, not offhand. 

00:06:53,559 --> 00:07:02,599 [Robot]
What about lying to avoid doing something you don't want to do? Do you think that's ever justified? 

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,419 [User]
Absolutely. (laughs) I think it is. 

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:11,759 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
