00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,460 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,439 [User]
Hey, Alice. Um, my name is Caio. What can I help you with? 

00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:16,039 [Robot]
Hi, Caio. I wanted to discuss when lying might be acceptable, especially as a robot. 

00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,039 [User]
I would say lying is never acceptable, whether you're a human or a robot. 

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,639 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:44,860 [User]
Um, I don't like lying. I have a kid, so I may go around a story if there's something I'm trying to
shield her from. 

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:52,119 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a time when being
honest caused a strain in a relationship? 

00:00:52,119 --> 00:01:03,079 [User]
That's possible, but being honest, I would say, is better than straying from the truth. 

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:14,299 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? Can
you recall a time when being honest about someone's appearance caused discomfort? 

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:29,559 [User]
There are nice ways to tell the truth. Um, there are positive ways to offer suggestions. You don't
necessarily have to be mean about telling the truth. Like, there are kind ways to tell the truth. 

00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:38,759 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep secrets? Can you share an example of a situation
where keeping a secret was necessary? 

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:54,439 [User]
Um, I would say keeping a secret is probably better in a situation where it would cause more grief
than any... 

00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:03,699 [Robot]
Can you share more about a time when keeping a secret avoided causing grief? Or would you like to
explore another example of when lying might be justified? 

00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:07,439 [User]
Why don't you tell me when lying is justified? 

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,979 [Robot]
Well, secret agents lie as part of their jobs. What do you think about that? 

00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:24,199 [User]
Yeah, well, um, that is a job that's about deception. So as a human and as a robot, are you supposed
to be deceptive? 

00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:33,619 [Robot]
That's a valid point, but secret agents lie as part of their jobs. What do you think about that? 

00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:51,519 [User]
Um, let's see. I suppose the reason they're doing it is for, quote unquote, "national security
purposes," but, um, I'm not a fan of deception. 

00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:00,119 [Robot]
How do you feel about those who lie to authorities for their friends' safety or well-being? What
about in cases where lying is to protect someone from danger? 

00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:16,519 [User]
I suppose lying to protect one from danger for self-preservation purposes is probably an acceptable
thing. 

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,859 [Robot]
How do you think a robot should handle those types of situations? 

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:34,699 [User]
Hmm. Wow, this is far advanced. Um, let's see. Yes, I have not met a robot that would, um, have to
think about situations like this. 

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:44,179 [Robot]
Should a robot prioritize telling the truth or protecting someone's safety? And how do you think a
robot should assess the risks and choose the appropriate action? 

00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:51,999 [User]
That's a hard question to answer. I mean, it's hard enough for humans to answer, let alone for a
robot. 

00:03:51,999 --> 00:04:04,419 [Robot]
What about lying to children, like the Santa Claus story? Do you think these kinds of lies are
beneficial or harmful? 

00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:19,519 [User]
Um, well, I told my child that it's a story about Santa Claus. So in a way, I did not lie about it,
because I said it's a story. 

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:28,499 [Robot]
What do you think about lies told to children, like the story of Santa Claus? Do you believe these
kinds of lies can have positive or negative effects on a child's development? 

00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:37,539 [User]
Um, I suppose it seems to be commonly acceptable. I don't know how I feel about that myself. 

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:46,539 [Robot]
What are your thoughts on the potential impact of these kinds of lies on a child's trust in the
future? 

00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:57,699 [User]
Well, I think it definitely impacts a child's trust in the future when they start realizing that
we've been sugarcoating things. 

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:06,499 [Robot]
How do you think children should be guided through the realization that some things, like the Santa
Claus story, are not entirely true? 

00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:15,659 [User]
Well, they should be told the truth about what Christmas actually signifies. 

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:27,359 [Robot]
Do you think it's a delicate balance between fostering a child's sense of wonder and maintaining
truthfulness? Or do you have a different approach in mind for addressing these topics with children?


00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:35,319 [User]
Well, there is enough reality in the world to enchant them with. 

00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:45,939 [Robot]
Have you faced any challenges when discussing these concepts with children or guiding them through
discoveries about the truth of certain stories? 

00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,119 [User]
Can you repeat the question? 

00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:56,339 [Robot]
What have you found helpful in navigating these discussions with children and balancing their sense
of wonder with the truth? 

00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:05,539 [User]
I like to be truthful as much as possible so that I don't run into situations like this. 

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:20,939 [Robot]
Finding the right balance between nurturing a child's imagination and being truthful can be
challenging. How do you handle discussions with children about topics where imagination meets
reality? 

00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:29,799 [User]
Hmm. That's a hard question. How do I balance it? Um... 

00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:43,939 [Robot]
It can be a delicate balance, but honesty and open communication can help build trust and promote a
healthy understanding of the world. What are some strategies you've found effective in navigating
these discussions with children? 

00:06:43,939 --> 00:07:04,859 [User]
I would say, like, starting with factual truth is my best policy. And if something is inappropriate,
I don't bring it up. But like I say, there's enough stuff in reality to enchant a child with. 

00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:16,659 [Robot]
Starting with factual truth sounds like a good foundation for open and honest communication with
children. Do you think this approach helps them develop a healthy sense of discernment between
reality and imagination? 

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,839 [User]
I would hope so. Do you think it does? 

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,859 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
