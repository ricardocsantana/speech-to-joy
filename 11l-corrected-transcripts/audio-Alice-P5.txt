00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,039 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,919 [User]
Hi, Alice. Nice to meet you. What can I help you with? 

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,979 [Robot]
I heard about a situation where my friend lied to protect someone, and they thought it was
justified. What do you think about that? 

00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:21,459 [User]
It really depends what the lie was about. 

00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:25,439 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,959 [User]
You want me to tell you about a situation where I lied to protect a friend? 

00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:40,939 [Robot]
Yes, or any other example where you found lying to be justified. Or maybe a situation where you
found it to be the wrong choice. 

00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,819 [User]
Um, I don't tend to lie. 

00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:55,759 [Robot]
If you need some inspiration, I can share some scenarios related to lying that you may have come
across, like lying to protect your friends' privacy, or keeping a secret for someone's wellbeing. 

00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:07,419 [User]
Yes. So, I have done the second one before. I knew that a friend of mine was cheating on her
ex-boyfriend and I didn't say anything to him. 

00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:17,979 [Robot]
That's a tough situation. I can understand why you felt the need to keep quiet. When it comes to
relationships, it can be especially challenging to navigate honesty and loyalty. 

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,379 [User]
Absolutely. It was very difficult. 

00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:30,279 [Robot]
It's a delicate balance indeed. It's commendable that you prioritized your friend's trust, even
though it was a challenging decision. 

00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:35,279 [User]
Thank you. So, how can I help you and your friend? 

00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:41,079 [Robot]
Can you think of a time when being honest might have strained a relationship, and how did you handle
it? 

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:59,199 [User]
There was a time where I was in a friend group and two of them were having issues and talking about
each other, and I told one of them what the other said, and it became a massive fight that I did not
need to... I did not need to do that. 

00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:08,119 [Robot]
It's really hard to see friends in conflict. It sounds like you had good intentions, but it's also a
reminder of how delicate those situations can be. 

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,639 [User]
Oh, absolutely. 

00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,839 [Robot]
Have you and your friends been able to resolve the conflict since then? 

00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:23,179 [User]
Uh, I'm still friends with both of the girls that were in the situation, but they are not friends
with each other now. 

00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,839 [Robot]
That can be a tough spot to be in. 

00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,079 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:34,279 [Robot]
It's impressive that you've managed to maintain both friendships. If you don't mind me asking, how
do you navigate talking about one friend to the other now? 

00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:50,499 [User]
I tend to just not do so, so I keep the friendships separate and they don't talk to each other, so I
don't talk about them to each other because it's just nobody's business at the end of the day. I'd
would rather focus on my relationship with each of these girls. 

00:02:50,499 --> 00:03:00,879 [Robot]
That's a wise approach. It's essential to protect the privacy and trust of each friendship.
Maintaining those individual connections is important. 

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,299 [User]
I agree. That's all we have at the end of the day. 

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:15,599 [Robot]
It sounds like you have a good understanding of the boundaries required to maintain those separate
friendships. It's valuable to prioritize respect and confidentiality in each relationship. 

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,699 [User]
Thank you. I agree. 

00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:28,979 [Robot]
Do you think there are certain situations where keeping a secret to protect someone's feelings is
more important than being completely honest with everyone involved? 

00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:41,819 [User]
I do think so. I believe that some things are better left unsaid, especially if the truth doesn't
actually change anything and it would only hurt someone's feelings. You might as well keep it to
yourself. 

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:52,779 [Robot]
Absolutely. It's a delicate balance. Protecting someone's feelings can be just as important as being
completely honest, and in some cases, it can even strengthen the trust in the relationship. 

00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,339 [User]
I agree. 

00:03:54,339 --> 00:04:08,959 [Robot]
It's important to approach these situations with empathy and understanding. Maintaining the trust
and respect in our relationships requires thoughtful consideration of when to share sensitive
information. 

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,959 [User]
Exactly. I follow the golden rule of, uh, treat others the way you wanna be treated, so this goes
for that as well. 

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,419 [Robot]
That's a wonderful principle to live by. Taking the feelings of others into account shapes how we
navigate our relationships. 

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,239 [User]
I agree with you, Alice. 

00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:37,719 [Robot]
Can you recall a time when being honest in a difficult situation ultimately strengthened a
relationship? 

00:04:37,719 --> 00:05:01,399 [User]
Um, it must have been when I was traveling with some friends and they wanted to do some extra side
trips and I just couldn't afford it, so I had to speak up for myself and tell them that I can't
afford it, because my ego wanted me to just say, "I don't wanna come." I didn't want to admit to
them that I didn't have the money for it. Um, but I think our friendship was benefited by me being
honest. 

00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:17,799 [Robot]
It sounds like that was a tough situation to navigate, but your honesty likely led to a stronger
understanding between you and your friends. It's important to communicate our boundaries and
limitations in a considerate way to maintain trust and respect in our relationships. 

00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,319 [User]
Yep. 

00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:29,619 [Robot]
Absolutely. Being open and transparent about our limits can deepen our relationships and create a
stronger sense of trust. 

00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,959 [User]
Yep. 

00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:39,539 [Robot]
Have you ever experienced a situation where telling the truth was challenging because it involved
potentially hurting someone's feelings? 

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:55,299 [User]
Uh, the situation that I mentioned earlier with one of my friends cheating on her ex-boyfriend. Um,
uh, he was my friend as well. I really wanted to tell him so he knew for his own feelings, but I
didn't because she was my closer friend. 

00:05:55,299 --> 00:06:08,239 [Robot]
It can be difficult to navigate those situations, especially when it involves loyalty to a close
friend. Have you ever discussed the situation with your friend and expressed your feelings about it?


00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:19,999 [User]
Um, you pronounce those words very funny (laughs). I actually have not. This is something that we
have not talked about that much because it is a bit of an awkward subject for me. 

00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:36,379 [Robot]
It's understandable that it's a sensitive topic, and it can definitely be uncomfortable to bring up.
It's important to consider the best approach for discussing it with your friend. If you ever wanna
talk about strategies for addressing these difficult conversations, I'm here for you. 

00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:41,979 [User]
Thank you for that one, Alice. I'll, uh, I might hit you up. 

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:52,459 [Robot]
Of course. I'm always here to lend an ear and offer support. It's essential to navigate these
delicate situations in a way that feels authentic and considerate to everyone involved. 

00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,519 [User]
100%. I agree. 

00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:03,019 [Robot]
Have you ever been in a situation where lying was necessary to protect someone from potential harm? 

00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,799 [User]
I don't think I have actually. 

00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:17,619 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
