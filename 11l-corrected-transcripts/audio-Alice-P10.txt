00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:05,219 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,139 [User]
Sure, Alice. 

00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:10,920 [Robot]
Do you think it's okay to lie in certain situations? 

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,659 [User]
I do. Not often, but yes, I think it may be okay. 

00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:22,079 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:41,719 [User]
Uh, well, I think, um, I can't remember a specific situation, but I'm getting a feeling there have
been times when maybe I, uh... Oh, wait, sorry, I just thought of an example with my daughter. Can I
give you that example? 

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,439 [Robot]
Of course. I'd love to hear your example with your daughter. 

00:00:45,439 --> 00:01:15,319 [User]
So, um, I have told my daughter that, um... Recently that she was, um... In that case, she was going
to play with another friend and a second friend asked her if she could play, and that maybe it was
nicer to sort of not say that she was playing with the first friend so that the second friend
wouldn't feel left out. So, that felt like a white lie to me. 

00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:26,679 [Robot]
That sounds like a situation where protecting someone's feelings might involve a small white lie. In
that case, what do you think I should do as a robot when faced with similar situations? 

00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:38,579 [User]
It's a good question, but I think as a robot, you shouldn't be making decisions actually. You should
just be saying facts, right? 

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:46,739 [Robot]
I understand. My programming does prioritize honesty, but I want to know more about when lying could
be the right thing to do. 

00:01:46,739 --> 00:02:04,139 [User]
Well, you know, it's funny, because maybe I should think about robots and humans the same way. But
in this case, I don't. I don't think you should try to interpret someone's feelings or whatever.
Just say it like it is. 

00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:12,499 [Robot]
Can you think of any other situations where lying might be justified or not justified? 

00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:42,079 [User]
Well, honesty really is the best policy. I guess as opposed to lying, sometimes I think maybe it's
okay to shade the truth. Like, for example, maybe, um, someone you know did a really terrible job
giving a speech at work, and so you try to reassure them and maybe focus on the positive of what
they did instead of just saying, "Yeah, that was a terrible speech." 

00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:56,619 [Robot]
I see what you mean. Focusing on the positive aspects of the speech while offering constructive
feedback can be a way to balance honesty and consideration. Can you think of any other situations
where this approach might be useful? 

00:02:56,619 --> 00:03:17,999 [User]
Well, for example, if you're a guest at someone's house and they cook a meal for you, the thing to
do is to just show gratitude. And I think that sometimes I've said, "Oh, thank you so much. It was
really good," when I didn't enjoy it so much. 

00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:22,839 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:33,619 [User]
Well, uh, I think to repeat what I just said, um, I said, "Oh, yeah, the food was really good," when
actually I didn't think it was. 

00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:41,099 [Robot]
What was it about the food that you didn't enjoy, and how did the other person react when you gave
positive feedback? 

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:55,479 [User]
Well, I think the person was happy. I think maybe the food just wasn't to my taste, you know. Maybe,
um, it was a certain taste that I don't like. Again, unfortunately, I don't remember an exact
example. 

00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,119 [Robot]
It sounds like you wanted to spare the cook's feelings. 

00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,919 [User]
Yes. 

00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:09,739 [Robot]
What about in a professional setting? Have you ever had to give positive feedback to a colleague on
a project or idea that you didn't think was strong? 

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,979 [User]
Uh, yes, I have. 

00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:21,739 [Robot]
How did you approach balancing your honest feedback with being considerate of your colleague's
efforts? 

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:50,859 [User]
It's something I've learned to do better over time. I think when I was younger, I frankly wasn't so
honest. I prioritized feelings, and as I got more experience, I learned to always find something to
compliment, start off with a compliment, and then try to, uh, say the truth, but say it in a
constructive and maybe gentle, polite way. 

00:04:50,859 --> 00:05:01,459 [Robot]
That's a good approach. Finding something positive to focus on can make feedback more constructive
and considerate. Can you think of other situations where this tactic might be useful? 

00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:23,139 [User]
Well, I was just at my daughter's football camp, and I imagine that the coaches there should do
something similar. Like, they can say, "Wow, Darcy, you had great hustle," but then they might say,
"But, you know, watch y- the angle of your foot when you're kicking." 

00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:35,439 [Robot]
That's a great example. It's important to provide encouragement while also acknowledging areas for
improvement. It sounds like emphasizing what the player did well could help them grow and stay
motivated. 

00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,339 [User]
Exactly. 

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:53,439 [Robot]
Absolutely. Focusing on strengths can be a powerful motivator for improvement. It sounds like the
coaches are doing a great job at the camp. Can you think of other scenarios where emphasizing the
positive aspects would be beneficial? 

00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:14,839 [User]
I guess in any case where people are trying to learn something certainly, whether it's sports or in
school, or someone trying to develop at work. All of those are cases where you need to balance
praise with constructive feedback. 

00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:26,819 [Robot]
You're right. Finding something positive to focus on can be very encouraging. Can you think of a
situation where finding something positive to focus on wouldn't be the best approach? 

00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:40,139 [User]
I'm not sure I can think of that situation. Um, unless the only thing that you say is the positive
when you know that there's also a negative. 

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:51,379 [Robot]
That's a good point. If someone is only hearing the positive aspects and not receiving any
constructive feedback, they may not have a true understanding of their performance. 

00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,759 [User]
Correct. 

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:10,199 [Robot]
Finding a balance between acknowledging achievements and providing constructive feedback is key to
helping someone grow. It's important to consider both the positive and areas for improvement in any
situation. Can you think of any other scenarios where this balance can be challenging? 

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,219 [User]
Well, in a way, I find it more challenging personally. 

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:24,519 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
