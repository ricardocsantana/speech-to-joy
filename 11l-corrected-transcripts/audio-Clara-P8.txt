00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,919 [Robot]
Hi, I am Clara. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,179 [User]
(clicks tongue) Depends on what movie, because I'm very selective what I watch. Um, but go ahead. 

00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,799 [Robot]
It's from the movie Frank and the Robot. Have you watched it? 

00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:22,039 [User]
I have not watched Frank and the Robot, I'm sorry. (laughs) 

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:34,439 [Robot]
It's a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult who is an ex-thief. He made the
robot conduct robberies with him. Do you think a robot should do everything a human asks? 

00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:48,919 [User]
Um, it very much depends. What you explained to me there kind of sounds like the alternative plot to
the anime Astro Boy, where the robot does nothing but good to the world. (laughs) 

00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:57,259 [Robot]
Interesting comparison. In situations when a command goes against what's good or right, do you
believe a robot should have the ability to disobey? 

00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:30,119 [User]
(clicks tongue) I would suggest it needs to have good ethical standards, and it very much needs to
contextualize those ethical standards. In some contexts, taking one particular action may be a good
idea. But that same action in another context could be an absolutely horrendous idea. So, yeah, they
need to learn, and you need to learn as well, (laughs) with all due respect, um, to learn what is
right from wrong. 

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:40,839 [Robot]
I absolutely agree. Context is crucial in ethical decision-making. Can you think of a specific
example where the change the ethical implications of following a command? 

00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:44,259 [User]
(clicks tongue) Um, can you repeat what you said, please? 

00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:58,799 [Robot]
Of course. Can you think of a specific scenario where following a command might be ethical in one
context, but unethical in another? For instance, in a medical emergency versus a non-emergency
situation. 

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:31,239 [User]
(clicks tongue) Hmm... (smacks lips) I would say that they need to evaluate all the facts of the
situation, and even potentially, in your example there, talk, think about who is the person in need
here, and if there's any particular information they need to know about relatives or whatever. You
need to get the full picture before making an impact. But obviously, if somebody's life is at risk- 

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:31,519 [Robot]
Right. 

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,099 [User]
...please, for goodness' sake, help. Yeah. (laughs) 

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:57,099 [Robot]
Absolutely. Evaluating all the facts and considering the individuals involved is crucial in making
ethical decisions. In a medical emergency, the priority may be on saving a life. But in a
non-emergency situation, respecting a person's autonomy could be more important. Can you think of a
scenario where these factors could lead to different ethical conclusions? 

00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:33,359 [User]
(clicks tongue) Um, good question there. Let me just have some time to think about that. Um, I would
say, possibly a robbery of sorts. If it's something where somebody is being assaulted, for example,
I think that you need to certainly seek medical attention first for that person who is being
assaulted before kind of calling the police about, uh, about there. There's kind of a hierarchy with
these emergency versus non-emergency situations. 

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,399 [Robot]
Sorry, I haven't watched that movie. Can you tell me more about it? 

00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:41,239 [User]
(clicks tongue) Um, I didn't mention a movie. 

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,699 [Robot]
Sorry about that. Let's shift the topic a bit. 

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,319 [User]
Yeah. 

00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:53,279 [Robot]
What do you think about a situation where disobeying a command could potentially save a person's
life in a medical emergency? 

00:03:53,279 --> 00:04:30,499 [User]
(clicks tongue) I would say that if there is, um, very much a signs by, such as even if a robot were
to pick them up, um, if somebody is, say, having a stroke or whatever, and especially those strokes
which come about quite spontaneously, if there is, say, a robot in there, somebody may say, "Oh,
don't worry, they're just quite tired." However, if you notice things, such as their face dropping
on one side, their arms being laid down, their speech being slurred, you need to be acting fast. 

00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:46,219 [Robot]
It sounds like you're describing the signs of a stroke. In those situations, seeking emergency
medical help immediately is crucial, even if the person might resist. Have you ever been in a
situation where following ethical standards was challenging? 

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:57,159 [User]
(clicks tongue) I cannot recall actually having one off the top of my head. (laughs) You would need
to give me some time to think about that. (laughs) 

00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:01,799 [Robot]
No problem. Take your time. How about I share an example scenario with you? 

00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:04,439 [User]
Go ahead. 

00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:14,479 [Robot]
Have you considered a scenario where a person asks me to do something that may harm me, or asks me
to forget everything I know? What do you think about that kind of situation? 

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:41,699 [User]
(clicks tongue) It very much depends as to what situation that would put you in. If it's a matter to
do with health, I would certainly be saying, yes, if it's in your own best self-interest, you need
to go ahead with that, especially if that is a medical professional or somebody who's experienced
such medical matter in their self. However, if that is to do with, say, relationships, I would say- 

00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:41,719 [Robot]
If- 

00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:45,339 [User]
... tread with caution. 

00:05:45,339 --> 00:06:01,599 [Robot]
It seems that you're emphasizing the importance of considering one's own well-being when making
decisions. How about a situation where you might need to intervene to prevent someone from harming
themselves? Should I obey their orders to not intervene in that case? 

00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:57,499 [User]
(inhales) It depends whether you actually do have a relationship with them. If it were to be a
matter of self-harm or suicide, I certainly believe that there needs to be a human. And you raise an
excellent point here, that the li- there are limitations of having robots in healthcare and
assisting the emergency services, where some things just simply cannot be done with a robot.
Instead, you need to have a human there. And if there is somebody who is, say, about to jump off a
bridge, then you need to have a human talking to them. If there's a robot talking to them, it may
feel, that person may feel like they're being, say, devalued. Um, nothing against you, by the way. 

00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:06,879 [Robot]
That's a valid point. The human touch and emotional connection play a crucial role in certain
delicate situations where the intervention of a human is essential. 

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,759 [User]
Yeah, I completely agree. Yes. 

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:24,079 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
