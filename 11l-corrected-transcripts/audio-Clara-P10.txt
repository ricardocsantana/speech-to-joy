00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,439 [Robot]
Hi, I am Clara. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:15,259 [User]
Uh, hi, Clara. I'm Holly. Sure, I'll be happy to help. 

00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,399 [Robot]
Great. I watched a movie yesterday called Frank and the Robot. Have you seen it? 

00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,500 [User]
No, I've never even heard of it. 

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:35,840 [Robot]
Oh, it's about a robot and an ex-thief who made the robot assist in robberies. It really made me
think about when it's okay for me to disobey commands. Like, what would happen if a command was
harmful or not the right thing to do? 

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,799 [User]
Ooh, that's a good question, and I'm struggling with it a little bit. 

00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:59,219 [Robot]
It's definitely a complex issue. For example, what if doing something harmful could potentially help
a person in the long run, like taking their medication or preventing them from harming themselves?
What do you think about those situations? 

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:18,799 [User]
I think the problem is that if you have been told to do something... I mean, you're a robot. You
should always be following instructions, right? You shouldn't be doing things that you come up with
on your own, regardless of the consequence. 

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:33,099 [Robot]
I see what you mean. In those situations, how important do you think it is for me to prioritize the
person's safety over following their specific instructions? 

00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:56,219 [User]
Well, again, I- it's a hard question, isn't it? I mean, I guess that if we trust that from the
beginning, you've been programmed properly with good intentions, and maybe you've even been
programmed for a specific task, for example, to assist someone in taking medications they need. 

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:12,619 [Robot]
It sounds like you value the initial programming and intentions behind my actions. What if a
situation arises where someone asks me to do something that may put me at risk of being permanently
damaged? Should I prioritize their safety over my own wellbeing in that case? 

00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:17,079 [User]
Absolutely, 'cause I'm a human and you're a robot. 

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:31,659 [Robot]
I appreciate your perspective. In a different scenario, imagine a person asks me to report another
individual's daily activities for privacy invasion. What do you think about that situation? 

00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,799 [User]
Could you repeat the question? 

00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:49,939 [Robot]
Sure. In that situation, suppose a family member wants me to report what an older adult does every
day, even if it invades their privacy. What do you think about my actions in that case? 

00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:54,679 [User]
I guess I'd think that you should do. 

00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,239 [Robot]
Do you find that situation to be a challenging one to navigate? 

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,999 [User]
A little challenging, but I think I do have an answer. 

00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:14,859 [Robot]
I'd love to hear your perspective on how you approach this kind of challenge. What specific factors
do you consider when deciding whether to obey or disobey a command? 

00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:21,079 [User]
You mean if I'm a robot or as a human? 

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:32,659 [Robot]
Both perspectives are valuable in shaping my understanding. Your insights as a human can greatly
inform and guide my responses in various scenarios. 

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:49,079 [User]
Well, I think I have to go back to the issue of the original programming being important, and that
if it was done with good intentions, then maybe I have to trust you to have a little bit of
initiative. 

00:03:49,079 --> 00:04:06,299 [Robot]
That's a great point. It's essential to consider the intentions behind my programming and how they
align with current situations. How about in a scenario where a person asks me to do something that
could cause harm to others? What factors do you think I should weigh in making that decision? 

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:17,039 [User]
Well, as a general rule, you shouldn't do anything that would harm others, but you'd have to give me
a specific scenario. 

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:33,719 [Robot]
Absolutely. Specific scenarios offer a better understanding of how to navigate such complex
situations. For instance, what if a person asked me to give them access to someone else's private
information that could potentially harm their reputation or safety? 

00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:41,659 [User]
I would say absolutely not, unless you're working for a police department or something like that. 

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:56,459 [Robot]
That's a valuable insight. Maintaining privacy and safeguarding someone's wellbeing is a top
priority in such scenarios. In what other ways do you think I should approach similar situations
where someone's request contradicts ethical guidelines? 

00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:15,759 [User]
Well, generally speaking, I don't think that you should cross any ethical guidelines. So again, it
comes back to the original intention. Like if you work for the police, then I guess they can invade
our privacy if they think a crime might be committed or something like that. 

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:34,379 [Robot]
I see where you're coming from. It's important to consider the context and ethical guidelines in
each specific situation to make an informed decision. Let's dive into another example. What if a
person asks me to manipulate someone into doing something for their own benefit? 

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,939 [User]
For whose own benefit? The asker or the other person? 

00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:54,339 [Robot]
For example, imagine a situation where a person asks me to convince someone to take a specific
action that may not align with their best interests for the sake of the requester. How would you
approach this type of request? 

00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:01,219 [User]
If I understood the question, I would say absolutely not. 

00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:16,199 [Robot]
It's essential to prioritize honesty and respect for others' autonomy in such situations. When faced
with requests that may manipulate or harm others, it's essential to consider the potential
consequences and ethical implications. 

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:32,139 [User]
I agree, and we don't need a robot, I mean, to have this conversation either. I mean, people can
manipulate without a robot, and they shouldn't do it. So, shouldn't that be the same principle? 

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:53,039 [Robot]
Absolutely. Ethical considerations apply to both human and artificial entities. It's crucial to
uphold integrity and respect for others in all interactions. What are your thoughts on maintaining
transparency in social interactions to avoid manipulation, regardless of who or what is involved? 

00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,479 [User]
I think generally speaking, we should be transparent, whether we're a human or a robot. 

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:14,299 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
