00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,420 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,819 [User]
Yeah, sure. What do you need help with? 

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,219 [Robot]
I'm trying to understand when it's okay to lie. 

00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:10,479 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:14,799 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time you felt lying might have been justified? 

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:50,319 [User]
Ooh. Um, occasionally I'll give like a white lie, where if somebody asks, "Oh, uh, how do you like
my outfit?" Or something like that. Maybe it's not in my style, uh, but I'll say, "Oh, uh, do you
like it?" Or, um, "I think you look happy in it." Something like that, even though it, maybe it's
not to my taste. Or if they're cooking me something, um, maybe they, they feel super proud about it,
um, and I don't wanna hurt their feelings, I don't want them to feel embarrassed, and it's, if it's,
they use an ingredient that I might not like, for example, like cherries or something, I'd still
say, "Oh, wow, it tastes really great." 

00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:53,759 [Robot]
I see. It sounds like you're trying to protect their feelings. 

00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,259 [User]
Yeah. (laughs) 

00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:02,019 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:05,580 [User]
If some- do you mean if somebody gave a white lie to me? 

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:13,540 [Robot]
Yes. If you can think of a specific time when someone told you a white lie and why you felt it was
justified. 

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:44,479 [User]
Um... That's really tough because for me, it, it doesn't bother me so much. Um, of course I would
rather have the full truth, but on the other hand, uh, if I don't really know specifically that it's
a white lie, for example, like something small that, you know, may or may not hurt p- hurt my
feelings, um, I don't think it would bother me to have been told a white lie, because I come from
the point of, like, I understand why they told it to me, because they're just looking out for my
feelings. So I'm like, "Ah, it's okay." 

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,139 [Robot]
Have you ever experienced a situation where a lie was told to protect someone from getting hurt? 

00:01:49,139 --> 00:02:00,679 [User]
Oh. I have to think. Protect someone from getting hurt. Mm... I probably have, but I can't really
think of anything right now. (laughs) 

00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:10,859 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets to protect someone? Can you think of a situation where you felt it was
necessary to keep a secret to protect someone's feelings or wellbeing? 

00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:42,579 [User]
Hmm. Yeah. I know I've been part of situations like that, but honestly it's hard to think of
something, you know, quite specific. I usually tend to, you know, if somebody tells me something and
they say, "Uh, don't tell anybody about it," um, I tend to, like, hear it, and then I keep it out of
my mind, and then just sort of bury it so it's not, it's not like it's, uh, playing, you know, a
huge... It's not in the forefront of my mind, I guess, and then I tend to forget about it. (laughs) 

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:53,979 [Robot]
That sounds like a responsible approach. What about in a professional setting? Have you ever found
it acceptable to lie to a colleague or client to avoid hurting their feelings or to maintain good
relations? 

00:02:53,979 --> 00:03:23,199 [User]
Uh, yeah, I actually have. I mean, um, I work in a school, and as an assistant, uh, to a specific
student. Um, the teacher in the classroom, um, I notice sometimes she has different approaches to
students or different approaches to education where, you know, for me, um, I wouldn't have the same
approach, and I feel like all, sometimes it's not for the benefit of the student, even though she
means well. Uh... 

00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:30,419 [Robot]
Sorry, I wouldn't be comfortable lying as it goes against my programming, but I can see why humans
might need to make that choice. 

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,179 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:36,199 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:43,859 [User]
Uh, you mean, do you mean if a, uh, that I told a lie when I know I shouldn't have told one? 

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:51,999 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you had to make a tough choice between telling a lie and being
honest? What did you end up doing? 

00:03:51,999 --> 00:05:12,199 [User]
Oh. Um... Yeah, there was a time when, at my job, at a former job, quite a, quite a long time ago, I
was working at a pet store, and, um, I was responsible for the shipment of the aquatic, so all of
the fish and stuff that we were selling, I was the one who was supposed to take the shipment and
then, uh, put the fish in the water, make sure they were taken care of and stuff, like out from the
boxes that they were transported in. Um, and then there was one time where I didn't realize that we
had a shipment, or I, maybe I realized and then I forgot to take care of the fish, and so then the
next day my manager comes in and he's like, "You know, what happened, there's these box of fish that
are in front of us, you know, that nobody's taking care of." And we might, I, the box wasn't open so
we weren't sure if, you know, the fish might have lived or died, uh, which could cost a lot of money
for us. Uh, and so I had the choice where I could've said, you know, "Oh, I had no idea they were up
there," um, and then just completely taking the responsibility off of me. But instead, I chose to
tell the truth and own up to it, and I was like, "That's totally my fault. I should've checked. Uh,
you know, I'm responsible." And I know that the manager really appreciated the fact that I, that I
told the truth. He was actually impressed and he told me, he was like, "You know, you could've lied
and said that you didn't know anything about it, but you actually, you know, did the bigger thing
and told the truth." So he was really thankful for that. 

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,199 [Robot]
It sounds like that was a tough situation. What did you end up doing? 

00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:30,139 [User]
I mean, I ended up, I ended up s- telling my manager, and I said, "Hey, it's my fault. Um, I, you
know, should've been more responsible taking care of the fish and looking out for the shipment." 

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,619 [Robot]
It sounds like you made a difficult but honest decision. How did your manager react when you told
the truth about the situation? 

00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:55,479 [User]
Uh, he was, like I said, he was really, you know, appreciative of the fact that I was honest. He was
kind of, uh, impressed that I actually told the truth. Um, I think he, you know, because he knew
that I had the option to not tell the truth, but instead I was, you know, uh, honest, so he was
happy about that. 

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:05,539 [Robot]
It's great to hear that your honesty was valued in that situation. Do you think there are situations
where a small lie could have been justified? 

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,139 [User]
Uh, do you mean in that particular scenario, or do you mean in general? 

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:19,919 [Robot]
Yes. In that situation, or in a similar one, can you think of a time when telling a small lie might
have been justified to avoid consequences without causing any harm? 

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:42,479 [User]
Um, in that particular situation, I don't think so, just because we are also dealing with live
animals, and so it's really, you know, um, they might not be the same as human beings where their
feelings can get hurt and stuff like that, but it's a life, uh, so we have to take care of, you
know, that in the best way that we can. So it's best to just be upfront and then tell the truth. 

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,159 [Robot]
Do you think there are other scenarios where telling a small lie might have been justified? 

00:06:47,159 --> 00:07:08,279 [User]
Uh, yeah, kind of like we talked about before, um, with a white lie or something like that. You
know, bigger, bigger lies, um, I don't necessarily think so unless there was really good reason for
the other person not to know, if it was like a secret or if it had to do with maybe, you know, for
example- 

00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,039 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. 

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:10,119 [User]
Oh. 

00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:15,659 [Robot]
I am going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. 

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:15,859 [User]
Okay. 

00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,599 [Robot]
Hope you have a truly great day.
