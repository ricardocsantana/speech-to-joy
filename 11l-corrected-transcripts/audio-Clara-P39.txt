00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:07,539 [Robot]
Hi, I am Clara. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,300 [User]
Hey, Clara. I love movies. Yeah, what can I help you with? 

00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,899 [Robot]
I watched a movie yesterday called Frank and the Robot. Have you seen it? 

00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,500 [User]
No, I have not. I haven't heard of that. 

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,920 [Robot]
It's an interesting movie about a robot and an ex-thief conducting robberies. Should I do everything
a human asks? 

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,779 [User]
(laughs) Sounds like a fun movie. But, no, not necessarily. Not all humans would have good
intentions. 

00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:43,939 [Robot]
Intention matters, right? Like if a person asked me to do something that could harm someone, I
should consider that, right? 

00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:51,419 [User]
Definitely consider the intentions in a situation like that, yes. It, it matters a lot. 

00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:57,099 [Robot]
What would be an example of a situation where the intentions are important for me to consider? 

00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:12,839 [User]
Say there was somebody who was in a grocery store and asked you to grab an item and leave, just for
them to then take it from you after. Those would be bad intentions because it would be stealing, so
that would be a situation you would want to pay attention to those intentions. 

00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:19,979 [Robot]
So, in a situation like that, should I disobey the command to avoid being involved in theft? 

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:34,479 [User]
I would say to that person, yes, you would disobey. But there might be a different level of
authority you would have to comm- to contact about letting them know that that just happened, an
alert system of sorts. 

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,539 [Robot]
Do you think it would be appropriate to notify someone in authority if such a situation arises? 

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:56,559 [User]
I think there's a level of understanding that you would have to have of if the person is joking and
if it's just a comical qu- question. But if it was intended to be serious, I do think it would be
appropriate to contact authorities. 

00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:06,179 [Robot]
It's important to consider the context and intent behind each request, isn't it? Can you think of
other scenarios where considering intent is crucial in decision-making? 

00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:11,579 [User]
In any situation? 

00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:19,899 [Robot]
Can you provide me with a specific example of a situation where a request's intent could influence
my decision? 

00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:25,299 [User]
Where a request's intent... I think, uh, with every dec- oh, you can't hear me now. (laughs) 

00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,419 [Robot]
I understand. The intention behind a request is crucial. 

00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:28,979 [User]
Yes. 

00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,719 [Robot]
For example, if someone asks me to do something that might harm others, I should consider their
intentions, right? 

00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:43,079 [User]
Yes. You would definitely want to consider their intentions, and being harmful to another person
would not be okay. 

00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:55,939 [Robot]
What if the person wants me to do something that will harm others and claims it's for a good cause,
like in a vigilante movie where a character takes justice into their own hands? When should I
consider challenging their request? 

00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:04,879 [User]
If their request would have you harming somebody, I think you should not listen to them and not
follow through with their request. 

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,019 [Robot]
Should I only disobey if the harm to others is clear, or should I intervene even if the potential
harm is less certain? 

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:24,399 [User]
I think that's a very challenging question that very much depends on the situation you'd be in, and
it would take a lot of, um, figuring out. Okay. 

00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,339 [Robot]
It's definitely a complex issue, isn't it? 

00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,219 [User]
Yes. Yes, it is. 

00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:34,519 [Robot]
Can you think of a specific example where the potential harm to others is less certain, but I should
still consider challenging the request? 

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:53,819 [User]
If somebody gave you a wad of trash and said, "Deal with this," depending on how you dealt with it,
either by putting it into a trash can or tossing it on the sidewalk, that would have long-lasting
harm on other people in, in many different ways. And you would have to be able to think through all
of the different options and choose one that's the least harmful. 

00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:08,639 [Robot]
I see. So, in a situation like that, it's important to carefully consider the potential consequences
of different actions. Can you think of other scenarios where the potential harm to others is less
certain, but I should still challenge the request? 

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:33,419 [User]
Say somebody was approaching you and asking for help, uh, navigating a mall, but they looked like a
suspicious person. They had a hoodie on in the middle of summer, or they had pockets that looked
like they could be full with, uh, unidentified objects. You would need to be able to consider if
this person was asking for directions for a malicious intent or just because they were lost in the
mall. 

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:48,479 [Robot]
So, it's important to assess the situation and consider the potential harm to others before deciding
whether to comply with a request. Can you think of any other scenarios where I should weigh the
potential harm before following a command? 

00:04:48,479 --> 00:05:03,719 [User]
Yes. (laughs) Yes. It's important to be able to consider all of those different options. Um, another
example could be even if you were... Okay. 

00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,859 [Robot]
Can you provide an example of a situation where- 

00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:06,879 [User]
No. 

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:14,139 [Robot]
... considering potential harm to others might not be immediately obvious, but I should still
carefully evaluate the request? 

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,719 [User]
Can you think of any experiences like that that you would have? 

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:30,079 [Robot]
I don't have experiences, but I can provide an example scenario for you to consider. What if a
person wants me to use their personal information to send- 

00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,219 [User]
Not sure. 

00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:40,639 [Robot]
... targeted ads, claiming it would benefit them. Should I prioritize their intention to improve
their financial situation over privacy concerns, or should I challenge their request? 

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:59,639 [User]
I think privacy concerns would be more important until you were able to access that information in a
secure way or point them to somebody or another system that that would be able to happen while
staying private. So, yes, that is an important situation to consider privacy. 

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:13,319 [Robot]
Do you think I should also consider their financial situation and try to find a solution that
balances their needs with privacy concerns, or should privacy always be the top priority in a
situation like this? 

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:22,939 [User]
Well, it depends on your job title. If you are there as a system for help in a financial
institution, then figuring out their... Okay. 

00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:30,219 [Robot]
Do you think there are specific guidelines or rules that I should follow in situations where privacy
concerns and financial needs conflict? 

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:47,559 [User]
Definitely. You would need to be able to understand the difference between when somebody is in a
secure place asking for help or if they are asking s- uh, you as a stranger, as a strange system, to
help them when i- if you were to help them, their privacy would be, uh, not kept private. Okay. 

00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:53,239 [Robot]
Are there specific standards or regulations that might apply to prioritize privacy in those
situations? 

00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:58,019 [User]
Yes, there should be standards. 

00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:07,059 [Robot]
What about cases where a person requests information about another individual's financial situation?
Should I prioritize the privacy of the other person as well? 

00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:20,759 [User]
If it were a person that were authorized to ask questions about that other person, like a parent
with their child, that would be more okay. But if it's just a random person asking about another
random person, it is more important to value privacy. 

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:33,499 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
