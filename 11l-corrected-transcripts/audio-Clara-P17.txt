00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:09,239 [Robot]
Hi. I am CLARA. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:13,519 [User]
Yeah. Sure, CLARA. What do you need help with? 

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,119 [Robot]
Hi, there. Did you have a chance to watch Frank and the robot movie? It's really interesting. 

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,760 [User]
I've never actually seen it. I haven't heard of it (laughs) before either. 

00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:37,700 [Robot]
It is a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult, who is an ex-thief. He made
the robot conduct robberies with him. Should I do everything a human asks? 

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:49,779 [User]
Ah, interesting. Uh, it sounds like it could be a really fun movie. Uh, interest- a lot of
interesting, uh, moral and ethical concepts. What was your take on it? 

00:00:49,779 --> 00:01:00,899 [Robot]
It definitely raises some thought-provoking questions. What do you think? Should I follow every
command, or are there certain situations where I should think for myself? 

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:22,579 [User]
Uh, I think it's quite tough, uh, given the fact, you know, depending on what your function could
be. Um, of course, I do feel like it's important that, you know, especially when it comes to ethical
dilemmas, for example, um, you know, robbing a bank or whatever, that's probably not the best idea
to do that. So you should be able to think for yourself in that case. 

00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:34,639 [Robot]
When it comes to ethical dilemmas, I get that thinking for myself is important. Let's say a person
asks me to rob a bank, like in the movie. Should I refuse the command even if they insist? 

00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:52,559 [User]
Uh, I think you should refuse the command even if, you know, they insist. Uh, it's not really your
fault that you were created to rob a bank, but, uh, on the other hand, you know, the person who
created you, they shouldn't be asking you to rob a bank. It's illegal for anybody to rob a bank. 

00:01:52,559 --> 00:02:04,819 [Robot]
That makes sense. What about manipulating a person for their own good, like making sure they take
their medicine? Should I intervene in that case even if they refuse? 

00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:28,379 [User]
I think that's really tough. Um, you know, on the one hand, it's a, you're- you are trying to do a
good thing by making somebody take their medicine. I'm thinking of, like, Alzheimer's or dementia
patients, for example. Um, I guess it depends on the nature in which you, uh, do try to get them to
take their medicine. It's not like you're doing it from a place of... 

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:38,119 [Robot]
I see what you're saying. So in those scenarios, do you think it's okay to prioritize the person's
well-being over their personal choice not to take the medicine? 

00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:46,799 [User]
Um, I think in this situation, yes, it would be. 

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:58,939 [Robot]
I understand your point. Let's say the person really didn't want to take the medicine. Should I use
methods that could be seen as manipulative to ensure they take it? 

00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:20,399 [User]
Um, I think it depends on how, you know, the nature of the manipulation. For example, if you, you,
put on a different voice or something like that or if you try to get the person to change direction
of thought, for example, distract them, and then maybe then they decide to take the medicine after,
that could be okay. But if you're using more, uh... 

00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:28,039 [Robot]
I get it. So, using subtle techniques to encourage them to take the medication could be a possible
approach to consider. 

00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:39,959 [User]
Yeah. I think that could be, um, especially because, you know, it's a gentle- it's more of a gentle
approach. It's, you know, not quite manipula- manipulative in the, the bad way, I would say. 

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:55,139 [Robot]
Right. Subtle encouragement can be effective without feeling like coercion. What are some other
situations you can think of where influencing decisions in a less intrusive way might be beneficial
for a person's well-being? 

00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:19,159 [User]
Um, I mean, there could be a lot of different scenarios. One, one example I can think of is, uh, you
know, I w- I used to work at a preschool. And we had some children who would refuse to go inside
even though it was time to go inside for lunch. And so, instead of trying to get them to go inside
by saying, "Hey, now is the time," um, I told them to look at the sky because we had a lot of dark
clouds. 

00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:28,379 [Robot]
That sounds like a creative approach to gently guide them. How did the children respond to your
method? And were you able to use this approach in other situations as well? 

00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:52,219 [User]
Uh, they responded... (laughs) It worked really well actually because they looked at the sky. They
were like, "Oh my gosh. It's really cloudy." And I was like, "Yeah. What happens?" And so, by the
end of the conversation, they were totally ready and willing to go inside to the point where they
even said, "Ah, I decided to go inside by myself." Uh, they've, you know, owned up to their own
decision making even though I gave a subtle push. 

00:04:52,219 --> 00:05:03,839 [Robot]
It's fantastic to hear that your approach was successful and allowed the children to make their own
choices. Can you think of other situations where this kind of gentle guidance could be beneficial? 

00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,459 [User]
Um, I mean, definitely in s- 

00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:18,699 [Robot]
For example, in situations where someone is struggling to make healthy eating choices, how might
gentle influencing techniques work to help them without removing their agency? 

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:41,959 [User]
I mean, you could always say, "Hey, uh, you know, this other, uh," I don't know, "This other option
has more nutrients," for example. "It's better for your body." Or you could say, "Oh, uh, you
mentioned that you were tired this morning. Maybe try having, choosing a meal that has more," I
don't know, "vegetables or something to bring up the energy." 

00:05:41,959 --> 00:06:00,999 [Robot]
Exactly. Providing information about the benefits of certain food choices or linking it to their
well-being could help nudge them toward healthier options. How else do you think subtle influencing
techniques could be used in everyday scenarios to support someone's choices? 

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,579 [User]
Um, I don't know. It could... 

00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:12,279 [Robot]
For instance, how could gentle influencing be used to encourage regular physical activity or
exercise in a non-intrusive way? 

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:26,419 [User]
I mean, it could be as easy as saying, "Oh, uh, look at the leaves outside. They're changing colors.
We should go for a walk and take a look at the leaves." Or, "Oh, it's really warm outside. How about
we go take a swim?" Just really small, simple things like that. 

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:41,559 [Robot]
Those are great examples of how gentle influencing can support positive choices without removing
someone's agency. Do you think these methods can also be effective in encouraging healthier habits
in older adults, for instance? 

00:06:41,559 --> 00:07:00,719 [User]
I think definitely, if done in the right way. It's really hard to say, especially working with older
adults. Um, they might be more set in their, uh, set in their ways, so it's harder to influence them
one way or another. But if you can, uh, you know, be very, very subtle about it, I think it could
work. 

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:18,339 [Robot]
I see what you mean. It can be more challenging with older adults, but finding subtle ways to
encourage positive choices could still have a positive impact on their well-being. Can you think of
a specific scenario where these gentle influencing techniques might be useful for older adults in
your experience? 

00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:41,959 [User]
Um, in my experience, it was definitely, you know, personally, it was, like, getting my grandparents
to start moving around more. Um, they're much older. They wanna sit on the couch. So, it was, you
know, trying to get them to go out of the house, whether it's, you know, me driving them somewhere
and we walk around the supermarket or we walk around the neighborhood or something like that, so
just something to encourage them. 

00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:53,799 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
