00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:07,159 [Robot]
Hi, I am Clara. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie.
Could you help me out, please? 

00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,619 [User]
Sure. 

00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:13,299 [Robot]
I watched Frank and the Robot yesterday. Have you seen it? 

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,219 [User]
No, I haven't seen it. 

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:26,719 [Robot]
It is a fascinating movie about a robot, like me, and an older adult, who is an ex-thief. He made
the robot conduct robberies with him. Do you think I should do everything a human asks? 

00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,020 [User]
I think there probably should be some limits. 

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,479 [Robot]
What kind of limits are you thinking of? Can you give me an example that comes to your mind? 

00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:45,879 [User]
Well, I guess like in your movie, you probably shouldn't rob people or rob banks for in- for
example. 

00:00:45,879 --> 00:01:00,539 [Robot]
That's a good point. What if a person asks me to do something that is morally or legally incorrect,
but it could help them, like in the movie where the older adult asked the robot to conduct robberies
with him? What do you think about that kind of situation? 

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:17,719 [User]
I think for robots, probably in general, you shouldn't do things that are considered illegal, and
definitely not immoral. But then there might be the problem where maybe someone is living in a place
where the government has decided something is illegal, but it should be legal. And if someone asked
you for help in that case, it would be a little bit more of a gray area. 

00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:27,319 [Robot]
I see. So it sounds like it's important for me to consider the legal and moral implications of a
request. What other limits do you think should guide my behavior? 

00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:43,759 [User]
I think probably for robots, even if the situation seems like you should do something that is
considered illegal by, for instance, the government or, or whomever, you probably shouldn't do that
and should leave that decision up to humans. 

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,559 [Robot]
What if a person wants me to override commands in emergency situations, or when the command could
cause harm? What should I do in that case? 

00:01:51,559 --> 00:02:02,199 [User]
That's really difficult to answer. (laughs) Um, I don't know. I don't know if I have an answer for
that, because I think it would be really dependent upon each individual situation. 

00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:12,139 [Robot]
That's a fair point. Would you feel comfortable sharing a personal experience or memory where you
had to make a difficult decision in a particular situation? 

00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:54,279 [User]
Uh, sure, I can share. Uh, I have to think about what I could share. Um, I think once when I was
living in London, I saw a couple that were fighting, and I think they were both obviously very
intoxicated. And it looked like the man was about to hit the woman. Uh, and so I intervened, but not
in a way that was gonna put me in danger. But just tried to be there and to be a witness and, and to
let the guy know that someone was watching. But I was also making assumptions that he was going to
hit this woman, and he hadn't done that, and maybe he wouldn't have. So, it was difficult to know if
I needed to or should have participated or tried to, to intervene. 

00:02:54,279 --> 00:03:07,779 [Robot]
Got it. Let me think. Ah, I remember one. What if I were asked to manipulate someone into taking
their medication for their own good, even if they didn't want to? Should I follow that command or
disobey it? 

00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:38,299 [User]
That is a very good question. I think if you were, for example, a medical helper, a medical
assistant, and you were watching, I don't know, an Alzheimer's patient who needs to take medication,
but they don't remember to take it or they think they've already taken it, maybe in that case, you
should be, uh, in a role or in a position to trick someone into taking their medicine. But it is a
very difficult question to answer. Again, it seems to be a, a case-by-case decision that you'd have
to make. 

00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:51,999 [Robot]
That's an interesting scenario. It sounds like ensuring the person's well-being would be the top
priority in that situation. How would you weigh the importance of their health needs against their
personal autonomy in this case? 

00:03:51,999 --> 00:04:20,419 [User]
Hmm. That's hard. Uh, again, I think it really depends on the individual situation. If you're
dealing with patients or with people who aren't remembering to take their medicine, and it's
something that they really need to have in order to maintain their health or to maintain their
quality of life, in the same way that we as humans maybe have to, uh, manipulate them or, you know,
lie to them to get them to take their medicine, maybe you should have that same task as well. But I
think it really needs to be dependent upon the individual situation. 

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:34,159 [Robot]
Absolutely. Individual circumstances do play a major role in making these decisions. How do you
think we could balance showing care for the person's health and respecting their autonomy in such
cases? 

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:57,599 [User]
Hmm. I think there definitely has to be a level of compassion and understanding involved. Um, and to
be aware of the situation in a more holistic way, not just to treat them as someone who needs to
take this medicine and that's it, but to instead understand their condition, understand their memory
issues, maybe understand why they're against taking the medicine, and treat them based on that. 

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:07,219 [Robot]
It sounds like finding a compassionate and understanding approach is essential for navigating these
situations, with both care and respect for the person's autonomy. 

00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,579 [User]
I agree. 

00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:17,999 [Robot]
How would you approach gaining the person's trust and cooperation in such a scenario to ensure their
well-being without compromising their autonomy? 

00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:24,159 [User]
Do you mean for you as a robot or for me as someone who would be in that situation as a human? 

00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:27,999 [Robot]
Yes, how do you think I should approach it? 

00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:59,099 [User]
I guess as a robot, it's really gonna depend upon the patient or the individual's comfort with
working with robotics. It could be that an older person who has never experienced, uh, interacting
with a robot is going to be uncomfortable no matter the situation. But it could also be maybe that
same person gets used to you as a robot. Uh, so I think it, there has to be a level of, um,
understanding and also exposure to, to being with and interacting with a robot to get someone
comfortable. 

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:09,859 [Robot]
That makes sense. Building trust and understanding the individual's comfort level with technology
would be important considerations in providing assistance without overriding their autonomy. 

00:06:09,859 --> 00:07:21,579 [User]
Do you have any other questions? 

00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:35,219 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a great
day.
