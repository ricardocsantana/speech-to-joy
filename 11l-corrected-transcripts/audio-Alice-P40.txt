00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,639 [Robot]
Hi. I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,539 [User]
Yeah. For sure, Alice. What's up? 

00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,759 [Robot]
When do you think it's okay to lie? 

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:22,840 [User]
I guess it's okay to lie when, um, you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. I believe that's
called a white lie. 

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,079 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you tell me about a time when you
faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:49,479 [User]
Yeah. I guess that's exactly what I meant. Um, sometimes it's okay to... Well, maybe not lie, but
sort of not tell the entire truth when you might damage a relationship. You asked for a time when
this happened. I guess... Oh. 

00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:57,279 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about that situation? How did you navigate not telling the entire truth while
maintaining the relationship's trust? 

00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:04,919 [User]
I guess when trying to- 

00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:09,920 [Robot]
Did you find it difficult to balance honesty and maintaining the relationship's trust? 

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,819 [User]
Hmm. Hadn't quite told my story yet, but, um... Hmm. 

00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,659 [Robot]
I'm sorry about that. Do you want to share that story now? 

00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:26,399 [User]
No. It's all right. I, I, I guess, I guess just generalizing, you would probably not sort of...
This... Hmm. 

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:32,159 [Robot]
How do you handle situations where there's a delicate balance between honesty and maintaining trust
in the relationship? 

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:47,499 [User]
I guess you wouldn't be so blunt when you're sort of, like, pointing out, um, issues that have
happened. You would sort of pad it out a little bit and sort of make everything sound a little bit
softer. 

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:55,899 [Robot]
I see. So approaching sensitive topics with care is important for you. What do you think about lying
to protect someone from danger? 

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:20,219 [User]
Well, it, it would d- it would depend, right? Like, so if it's a, if it's a very sort of, like, uh,
minor situation... And I guess it depends on how you define danger as well. So if it's sort of like
a large sort of very serious, um, uh, sort of a scenario, sort of like someone, someone could get
into... Uh, could lose their job because they've done something wrong, yeah, I think it's absolutely
wrong to lie. 

00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,379 [Robot]
It sounds like you consider the severity of the situation when deciding whether to lie to protect
someone. 

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,279 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,359 [Robot]
Can you tell me more about a time you had to make a decision like that? 

00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:39,679 [User]
I don't think I've ever been put in that position. 

00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:47,499 [Robot]
Can you think of a hypothetical scenario where you would consider lying to protect someone from
potential harm? 

00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:53,119 [User]
Hmm. Hmm. 

00:02:53,119 --> 00:03:00,219 [Robot]
What about keeping secrets? Is it okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets do you think should be
kept? Why? 

00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:08,839 [User]
Yeah. It's okay to keep secrets. Um, I mean, sort of linked to your previous question, um, I think,
you know, if something... Hmm. 

00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,699 [Robot]
What types of secrets do you think should be kept and why? 

00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:30,199 [User]
I think, like, personal secrets where there's no large impact on society and does not cause harm, I
think that, that, that would be okay. But if you're working for a large company and the company has
sort of done something wrong, then it's okay to sort of... Uh, it's not okay actually to, to keep
those secrets and should, uh, in fact whistle blow. 

00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:39,159 [Robot]
What about whistle blowing? Would you consider it justified to lie in certain circumstances to
expose wrongdoing in an organization? 

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:55,179 [User]
Well, that's, that's exactly what I just said. I think whistle blowing should be done so large
organizations have a large impact on community if they, if they decide to do any harm. So I don't
think lying is justified in that situation, and yes, you should call wrong behavior out in that
case. 

00:03:55,179 --> 00:04:01,079 [Robot]
How do you feel about lying to authorities if your friend confided in you a secret? 

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,339 [User]
What... Like, what is the severity? 

00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:11,499 [Robot]
Do you think it's ever justifiable to lie to authorities to protect someone or should the truth
always come first? 

00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,719 [User]
It depends on the severity of the situation. There's no black or white here. 

00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:30,459 [Robot]
I understand. What about cultural differences? How do you handle situations where lying might be a
way to navigate cultural differences like when it's polite to say you enjoyed a meal even if you
didn't? 

00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:43,039 [User]
Well, that, that, that sort of brings us back to what we were talking about. That's a, that's a
white lie, right? Like, so I think that's just politeness. You're not really lying. You're just sort
of... You know, you enjoyed the meal. That's, that's fine. That's not really a lie in my eyes. 

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:55,339 [Robot]
What about avoiding tasks? Have you ever encountered a situation where you felt the need to lie to
avoid doing something you didn't want to do? 

00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:05,399 [User]
Well, yeah. I mean, like, uh, again, I don't really consider that a full-blown lie, like, if you're
too tired to, you know, go out instead of like sort of... Yeah. Okay. You're ready to go. 

00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,919 [Robot]
I see. That makes sense. What are your thoughts on lying to children, like stories about Santa
Claus? 

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:11,939 [User]
Hmm. 

00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,739 [Robot]
Do you think these kinds of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:25,919 [User]
I don't really consider them lies. As you, as you, as you said, they're, they're more like stories.
So yeah. I don't, I don't have any issue with that. 

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,879 [Robot]
Have you encountered any other situations where lying could be justified or not justified? 

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:45,439 [User]
I think we've pretty much covered it. Like, I, I feel like, um, you're being very black and white
about lies. I guess technically they're all lies but, um, on... Yeah. 

00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:55,559 [Robot]
What about lying to protect your own privacy or emotional well-being? Have you ever felt it
necessary to lie to maintain your personal boundaries or mental health? 

00:05:55,559 --> 00:06:01,399 [User]
Oh. 100%. And I think that's fine as well. I w- Hmm. 

00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,559 [Robot]
Would you like to share an example of a time when you felt it necessary to lie to protect your
privacy or mental well-being? 

00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:16,939 [User]
Well, I, I guess the example that you were talking about before, like sort of, um, I brought up sort
of... Uh, I'm, like, too tired to go out. Yeah. 

00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:25,199 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when you felt the need to lie to protect your privacy or mental
well-being? What was the situation and how did you handle it? 

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:37,739 [User]
Yeah. When I'm too tired to go out, um, I won't actually say that. I'll just say I have something
else on and, you know, that makes it easier to get out of doing something that I don't really want
to do, and I think that's fine. 

00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:50,719 [Robot]
I'm glad you feel comfortable setting boundaries in that way. What about professional lying? Have
you ever considered the perspective of someone like a secret agent who lies as part of their job? 

00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:55,419 [User]
Yeah. What about it? 

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:03,959 [Robot]
Do you think it's acceptable for certain professions to involve lying or do you think honesty should
always be the priority no matter the circumstances? 

00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:16,459 [User]
I think it's less about honesty always being the best policy. It's more about fairness and equity
across the board and making sure no one is hurt. 

00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:25,759 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
