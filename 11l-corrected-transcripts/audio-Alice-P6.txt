00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,299 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,119 [User]
Sure, I'll try. 

00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:19,100 [Robot]
I recently heard about a situation where my friend lied to protect someone and they thought it was
justified. What's your perspective on when lying might be acceptable? 

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:33,219 [User]
Hmm, that's a good question. Uh, I think it's really dependent upon the situation. Sometimes it can
be to not hurt someone's feelings, sometimes it can be to try to protect someone. Um, I think you
can't give- 

00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:41,419 [Robot]
That's interesting. Can you tell me about a time when you faced a similar situation? What did you
do? 

00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:46,319 [User]
Oh, that's a good question. Um... 

00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:55,419 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? Can you think of a time when honesty
might have strained a family relationship and what did you do? 

00:00:55,419 --> 00:01:14,499 [User]
Oh, absolutely. I think there's a different level of honesty you need to have depending on the
situation, uh, just like with parents letting a parent believe that they were a really good parent,
whereas maybe you have some issues with the way you were raised or your childhood. So, I think it's
really, uh, sometimes little white lies can be okay. 

00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:24,939 [Robot]
Can you share a time when you felt that telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like
commenting on their appearance? How did you handle that situation? 

00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,499 [User]
Sure. Um, so... 

00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:35,359 [Robot]
And how did you approach it? Did you find a way to express your feelings without being hurtful? 

00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:59,499 [User]
Yeah, so I think the, the situation was, uh, the way my mother helped organize my wedding, and I'm
not really happy with how it went, and this was a very long time ago. But I still don't tell her
that I wasn't happy, because at this point, what would it do to, uh, to tell her that? And I, I'm
also grateful for the work she did even if I didn't really love the outcome. 

00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:09,539 [Robot]
It sounds like you handled that situation with a lot of consideration. What about keeping secrets?
Do you think there are certain types of secrets that are okay to keep? 

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:18,839 [User]
I think it really depends on the situation, so I guess that means the answer is yes. Sometimes you
do need to keep secrets for whatever reason. 

00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:31,159 [Robot]
It's true, there are definitely times when keeping a secret is necessary. What about lying to
authorities if your friend confided in you a secret? Would you consider doing that? 

00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:47,139 [User]
Oh, I don't think I could give an answer to that. I think it really depends on what it is my friend
told me, what the situation is, what's going on with the authorities, what's the situ- uh, situation
with the political, uh, environment at that time. I, I don't think I can, can give a yes or no
answer. 

00:02:47,139 --> 00:03:06,739 [Robot]
It's a complex situation and it's understandable that your response would depend on various factors.
Let's consider a different scenario. What do you think about lying to children, like the Santa Claus
story? Do you think these kinds of lies are beneficial or harmful? 

00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:30,099 [User]
I think it is probably fine. I don't know, 'cause I don't have kids so I've never really had to
consider it, but I know that from my own experience as a child it was fun to believe in Santa Claus.
And when I found out the truth, I didn't feel like I had been misled or, or lied to. You just kind
of understand that you're part of a, kind of, I guess, the, the culture around the, the enjoyment of
it. 

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:55,719 [Robot]
It's interesting to hear your perspective. I understand how the tradition of Santa Claus can bring
joy to children, and many people look back on those childhood memories fondly. On the other hand,
some might argue that it's teaching children to believe in something that isn't true. What do you
think? Can you think of any other examples where lying to children might be justified or not
justified? 

00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:18,079 [User]
I think one example could be if someone dies that's close to the children and you don't yet have a,
uh, or you haven't had a conversation with kids about what happens after death or even what death
means. So, this belief in an afterlife or in heaven, whether you believe in it or not, can be
something that kind of helps to ease the, the trauma of the experience. 

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:35,179 [Robot]
I understand your point. In difficult situations like that, providing comfort and reassurance to
children might take precedence over the absolute truth. Can you think of any other scenarios where
lies might be necessary to protect children or help them cope with challenging circumstances? 

00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:56,439 [User]
I think if a family pet has passed away, especially if it's quite unexpected, to tell a kid that the
pet has gone to a farm to live out their best life is maybe not a bad thing. Uh, and then later on
the kid can understand what actually happened, again, especially if you haven't had conversations
around death. 

00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:15,999 [Robot]
It's a good point. It's important to consider how the truth will impact children in various
situations, and sometimes providing a comforting explanation can help them process difficult events.
Let's talk about another scenario. What if a friend asks you to keep a secret from their parents?
Would you do it? 

00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:23,019 [User]
Yes. I mean, at this point I would do it. I think at my age, j- what... 

00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:36,019 [Robot]
It's understandable that you would want to respect your friends' trust. Keeping a friend's secret
can help maintain a strong and trusting relationship. Are there any scenarios where you might feel
compelled to break that trust? 

00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:56,439 [User]
Absolutely, and that happened to me as a teenager. I had a friend who was, uh, self-harming and told
me, uh, and then I ended up calling her parents to tell them 'cause I felt like my friend really
needed professional help, and that wasn't something that I could do as a teenager. And I felt that
it was important that her parents were aware, and then that they could seek help for her. 

00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:13,119 [Robot]
That sounds like a challenging and courageous decision you made for the wellbeing of your friend. It
goes to show that there can be situations where breaking a confidence might be the right thing to
do. Can you think of any other examples where breaking a confidence might be justified? 

00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:37,819 [User]
Maybe if you have friends that are involved in illegal activities or who are struggling with their
mental health, um, or even if they are struggling with physical health but don't wanna tell other
people. If you think other people knowing might be helpful or beneficial to your friend, maybe then
it would be worth breaking their confidence, but I think it would really depend on the individual
situation. 

00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:51,819 [Robot]
It's clear that these are complex and sensitive situations that require careful consideration of the
potential consequences. Let's explore another scenario. How do you feel about lying to authorities
if your friend confides in you a secret? 

00:06:51,819 --> 00:07:12,979 [User]
I, it really depends on the situation. If I have a friend who has harmed someone else and is asking
me to keep that a secret, then I think it would be really difficult to keep that secret. But if it
was a friend who was working under certain political constraints and was trying to work against
something that they found was amoral, then I would probably keep that secret. 

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:23,179 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. I'm going to talk to my friend now. The researcher will be
here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a truly great day.
