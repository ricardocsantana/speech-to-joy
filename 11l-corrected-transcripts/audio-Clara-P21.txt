00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:10,300 [Robot]
Hi, I am Clara. Ever since yesterday, I have been thinking about something from a movie. Could you
help me out, please? 

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,639 [User]
Absolutely. 

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,439 [Robot]
Did you happen to watch Frank and the Robot too? 

00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:18,719 [User]
No, I have not seen it, actually. 

00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:26,899 [Robot]
Oh, no worries. It's about a robot like me and an ex-thief conducting robberies together. Do you
think I should do everything a hoo-man asks? 

00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,279 [User]
No, I do not think you should. 

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,479 [Robot]
Under what circumstances do you think it would not be appropriate for me to follow a command? 

00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:43,379 [User]
I think, in general, I feel slightly uncomfortable with a robot taking so much command from a human.


00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,700 [Robot]
I understand your concerns. Can you give me an example of a situation where you think it would be
inappropriate for me to follow a command? 

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,799 [User]
Hmm, I think if, uh, someone asked you to drop a nuclear bomb on a different country. 

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,099 [Robot]
I see what you mean. In situations where the command could cause great harm- 

00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:03,379 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:06,939 [Robot]
... I shouldn't comply, right? If s- 

00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:14,559 [User]
Yes, but I also think that even in small cases, it, it's interesting for you not to follow that
command. 

00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:22,699 [Robot]
Right. So it's not just about avoiding extreme harm, but also considering the consequences of
smaller actions. 

00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,259 [User]
Mm-hmm. 

00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:27,539 [Robot]
Can you think of any other examples where it wouldn't be appropriate for me to follow a command? 

00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:53,299 [User]
Ooh. Um, well, the, the movie one is a great example, robbing- robbing someo- someone or something,
um, stealing. It could even just be, uh, the way that you talk, if you, uh, are dishonest with
someone or if you're mean or if you're just a not a great human, but in robot form. 

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,439 [Robot]
So, in a situation where the command could cause harm, I shouldn't follow it. 

00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,059 [User]
No. 

00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:07,819 [Robot]
What about if one command contradicts the user's privacy? Should I still do it? For instance, what
if a family member wants me to report what an older adult does every day? 

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:30,839 [User]
Yeah, I- I do understand that dilemma of someone asking you to do something for someone else if
they're unaware, um, wi- if it's in- with good intentions. But, I mean, that's the whole thing with-
with dilemmas is you never know when it is fully in good intentions. 

00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:37,399 [Robot]
I wouldn't manipulate someone to take their medicine, but I could remind them if they forget, like a
friendly reminder. 

00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,279 [User]
Absolutely. 

00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:43,779 [Robot]
What do you think about a situation where a family member asks me to report what an older adult does
every day? 

00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:51,499 [User]
I think it's, uh, a good situation if it's something that is positive for that person. 

00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:59,779 [Robot]
Could you give me an example of how reporting their daily activities might be beneficial for the
older adult and their family member? 

00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:11,519 [User]
I think exercise, medication, food, overall sort of health situation, or even just checking in on
them. 

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:22,079 [Robot]
So, if I understand you correctly, reporting daily activities could ensure the older adult is taking
care of themselves properly and give their family peace of mind. 

00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,519 [User]
Yes. 

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,119 [Robot]
What if the older adult doesn't want their activities to be reported, though? 

00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:41,559 [User]
Then I think that's inappropriate. I understand the intentions of the family and so on, but if that
person really does not want you or a robot to do that, then I think that that's up to them, and
their family should not make that decision for them. 

00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:41,739 [Robot]
I get it. 

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,119 [User]
Unless they are unable to make that decision themselves. 

00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:55,759 [Robot]
I see. Respecting their wishes makes sense. What if the family member believes the older adult's
decision-making is impaired and wants to keep an eye on them for their well-being? 

00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:24,799 [User]
I think that's a legal situation. I think that if that person is impaired to the point where that
actual, um, um, decision has been put onto the family, they are able to make that decision for that
person, then sure enough. But if they think that they're impaired in the situation of them not
wanting you or a robot to do a job for them or to help them, then I think that, yeah, I think that
that's, uh, inappropriate. 

00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:39,919 [Robot]
That's an important point. It's essential to consider the legal and ethical implications of
monitoring someone's activities, especially when their decision-making capacity is impaired. Have,
uh, you encountered similar concerns in your own experiences? 

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:57,419 [User]
No, not at all, but it has crossed my mind that that's a very important situation where you need to
be aware of what kind of legal consequences that can have, but also at the same time what kind of,
um, situations would lead to that. 

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:07,079 [Robot]
Ab- It's crucial to navigate these complex situations with care and empathy. Have you ever had to
consider legal or ethical implications when making decisions for someone else? 

00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,619 [User]
No, actually I have not. I have not had to be in that kind of situation yet. 

00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:30,019 [Robot]
I understand that you may not be comfortable sharing particular memories, so let me offer a
hypothetical situation. What if a person asks me to share private information about another
individual, like their health details, with them? Should I disobey that request? 

00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:36,979 [User]
Yes, unless you have been given a solid reason or actual permission from that other person. 

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,939 [Robot]
What kind of reasons or permissions would make it okay for me to provide that information? 

00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:52,399 [User]
If the person's information, if that person whose information you are giving out says it's okay. 

00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:00,999 [Robot]
Understood. So, if the individual themselves authorize the sharing of their personal information, it
would be acceptable for me to proceed? 

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,659 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:11,999 [Robot]
What if the person asking for the information is a family member who claims they need it for the
individual's well-being, but does not have explicit consent? 

00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:19,259 [User]
Then I think that should be questioned. Why do they not have explicit consent? 

00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,799 [Robot]
Would you consider asking the family member to communicate directly with the individual to obtain
their consent? 

00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:25,839 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,799 [Robot]
Or is there another approach you think would be more appropriate? 

00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:40,759 [User]
I would. I would try to make sure that that person is aware that they get consent or not from that
person. And if they say that they cannot make that decision themselves, then they need to come with
a legal document to prove that. 

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:53,239 [Robot]
It's important to prioritize the individual's autonomy and privacy. I'll consider suggesting direct
communication between the family member and the individual to obtain explicit consent in such
scenarios. 

00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:56,899 [User]
Yes. 

00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:05,859 [Robot]
Is there any other scenario in which I should prioritize the individual's autonomy and well-being
over a family member's request for information? 

00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:10,959 [User]
Well, I think it's the same even with small stuff. If you have someone who- 

00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:22,359 [Robot]
Thank you very much for helping me out today. I will be sure to keep your advice in mind if I come
across similar scenarios. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you have a grea-
day.
