00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,279 [Robot]
Hi, I am Alice. Could you help me out with something? 

00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,919 [User]
Hey, Alice. Yeah, happy to. 

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,539 [Robot]
Great. Do you think it's okay to lie sometimes? When do you think it's okay to lie? 

00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:28,599 [User]
Ooh, that's a complicated question. I mean, white lies are okay and that's just when you're trying
to help somebody. But more important lies where you're potentially hurting somebody, that's not
always okay. It's tricky to decide. 

00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,119 [Robot]
When telling the truth could damage a relationship, do you think it's okay to lie to avoid hurting
someone? 

00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:49,819 [User]
Not necessarily. E- even if a relationship is damaged, sometimes the truth is more important and
sometimes you have to accept that you're hurting somebody, but we all make mistakes and we all do
things that are potentially hurtful- 

00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:49,840 [Robot]
Can- 

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,739 [User]
... and I think it's important to be truthful about that. 

00:00:51,739 --> 00:01:04,559 [Robot]
Can you tell me about a time when telling the truth could have damaged a relationship for you? What
did you decide to do in that situation? 

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:24,259 [User]
Yeah, I mean, eh, eh, and with every friendship, with every relationship, there are always times
where making decisions can be hurtful, but I- I think you just have to... I mean, what I did is I
made the decision and I decided am I gonna be true to myself or am I going to cushion this other
person's feelings? And I think sometimes it's important to be true to yourself. 

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:24,499 [Robot]
What- 

00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:30,339 [User]
And even if you hurt somebody else, being true to yourself and with your values is more important. 

00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:36,679 [Robot]
What if telling the truth might hurt someone's feelings, like commenting on their appearance? 

00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:51,499 [User]
Well, you wouldn't necessarily wanna comment on someone's appearance un- unless there was a reason
for that, if you were having a conversation about appearance, but sometimes you can just avoid those
topics of conversation. 

00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:54,379 [Robot]
What are some situations where lying might be justified? 

00:01:54,379 --> 00:02:15,939 [User]
The first example I thought of was having a parent tell a kid about the tooth fairy. If, uh, they're
scared about losing their tooth, their parent is gonna have a white lie and tell their children,
"Oh, this tooth is actually going to the tooth fairy, so it's okay to lose it." And in that
situation, it helps the little person feel better. 

00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,239 [Robot]
How do you think the child benefits from believing in the tooth fairy? 

00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:29,659 [User]
I think it can make the strangeness of losing a tooth less strange, less complicated and scary. It
can make them look forward to losing a tooth because they'll get a visit from the tooth fairy. 

00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,179 [Robot]
Less scary and more exciting for them? 

00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:36,359 [User]
Yes, exactly. 

00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:42,519 [Robot]
Is it okay to keep secrets? What types of secrets would you choose to keep? Why? 

00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:58,219 [User]
Well, it is okay to keep secrets because nobody else is required to know every single thing about
you. However, if it's a secret that involves somebody else, for example, if you were in a
relationship and hiding something important to the other person, that's not okay. But- 

00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:04,859 [Robot]
What kinds of secrets do you think are necessary to keep to yourself? Why do you think it's
important to keep those secrets? 

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:23,299 [User]
I don't think there's ever a secret that's necessary to keep to yourself. I think some people might
prefer to just not tell anybody everything about them. Could even be just like their favorite color.
That doesn't have to be a secret, but it doesn't have to be something that everyone knows about. So,
personal preference on, on what they wanna keep to themselves. 

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:29,379 [Robot]
What about lying to keep someone safe? Do you think it's okay to lie to protect someone from danger?


00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:46,859 [User]
Definitely to protect someone from danger. I- if there was a man approaching me on the street and
asked if I, you know, was meeting somebody, even if I wasn't, I'd say, "Yeah, my boyfriend's coming
soon," because that would keep me safe and I would expect anybody else in that situation to have a
similar strategy. 

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:53,559 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone from danger, like in your example? Would you consider that
justified? 

00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,459 [User]
Yes, I would. 

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:02,579 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone from danger? Would you consider it justified in other situations
as well? 

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:18,379 [User]
Yeah, I th- I think if the goal is to protect someone from danger, a white lie or even just a
passive lie could be definitely justified. If the goal is to save somebody, protect them from
danger, from illness, from, from pain, I think that can be okay. 

00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:29,019 [Robot]
What if the lying is to protect someone from emotional pain, like telling a friend that their outfit
looks great when it doesn't? Do you think that kind of lying is justified? 

00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:42,199 [User]
It depends. I think oftentimes with friends you want to build them up and support them, especially
if they're trying a new fashion style. You also don't necessarily have to comment on it if you don't
want to lie. It's a, it's a complicated- 

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:51,919 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth might damage a relationship? Can you tell me about a time when you
faced a similar situation? What did you do? 

00:04:51,919 --> 00:05:22,499 [User]
When I had to decide between telling the truth or lying, oftentimes I, I think about how I would
feel in the opposite situation. So, for example, I moved here to Sweden. My parents would have
preferred for me to go home, to stay home and live with them. But for me personally, this is a step
forward in my life. So even though telling them that I was about to leave the country for a couple
years was gonna hurt them, I had to do it because it was important for me to be moving forward. So
I- 

00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:24,299 [Robot]
And how did you handle that situation? 

00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:41,379 [User]
I, I think I sat them down and I, I talked to them about what I wanted for my future and said, "I, I
know this is a big change and I know this is not necessarily the comfiest change, but it's important
for me to move on and important for me to move forward and it's important for you guys to, to not
have me at home too." 

00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,699 [Robot]
How about when telling the truth could damage a relationship? 

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:53,879 [User]
Sometimes not every relationship will survive. And if the truth is something important, then even if
it hurts, it's important to share. 

00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:02,759 [Robot]
What if lying is to protect someone's feelings, like when commenting on their appearance? Do you
think that kind of lying is justified? 

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,539 [User]
It depends. Or do you have a specific situation you're thinking of? 

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:15,859 [Robot]
What if a friend asks for your opinion on their appearance and you think their outfit doesn't look
great? How would you approach that situation? 

00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:32,639 [User]
I would tell them something I did like. Wouldn't be a lie. It might not answer exactly their
question they're asking, but I would skirt around the subject and say, "I- I think your hair looks
great today," or, "I think your, your energy today is wonderful." Then- 

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:44,039 [Robot]
What if you were in a situation where you believed the truth could damage a friendship, but lying to
keep the peace might also be harmful in the long run? What do you think you would do in that
scenario? 

00:06:44,039 --> 00:07:09,679 [User]
I think if the relationship is one that I would want to last, I would tell the truth and, and I
would sit them down and I would have an honest conversation. And it might be an emotional
conversation, but if the goal is to have a long-lasting relationship, dealing with conflict, uh,
isn't... you wouldn't do that through lying. You do that through telling the truth, working through
a problem when it arises. And when- 

00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:09,819 [Robot]
It's- 

00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,119 [User]
... I've done that, I've may have been able to have relationships last longer. 

00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:20,499 [Robot]
Thank you so much for helping me out. The researcher will be here soon to give you a form. Hope you
have a truly great day.
