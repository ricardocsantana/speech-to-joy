I need to rate each of the 8 questions based solely on the transcript of the conversation between the human participant and the Furhat robot (Alice).

Looking at the transcript:
- The interaction appears to be a discussion about ethics, specifically when it might be acceptable to lie
- The robot asks questions and follows up on the participant's responses
- The conversation flows relatively naturally, though there are a couple of instances where the robot repeats questions

Let me evaluate each question:

1. It was fun talking to the robot
The conversation seems to flow well, but is on a somewhat serious topic (lying). The participant engages but doesn't express explicit enjoyment. They laugh occasionally which might indicate some level of comfort.
Rating: 5 (Slightly agree)

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting
The topic of ethics and lying is inherently interesting, and the robot asks thoughtful follow-up questions that seem to engage the participant.
Rating: 6 (Moderately agree)

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot
The conversation flows reasonably well, though there are a couple instances where the robot repeats questions. The participant seems to engage throughout, suggesting a satisfactory experience.
Rating: 5 (Slightly agree)

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot
Similar to question 1, the participant seems engaged but not explicitly enthusiastic.
Rating: 5 (Slightly agree)

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation
The robot asks follow-up questions and seems to respond appropriately to the participant's answers, showing it's following the conversation.
Rating: 6 (Moderately agree)

6. I found the robot fascinating
There's no explicit indication the participant found the robot particularly fascinating.
Rating: 4 (Neutral)

7. I found the robot boring

Rating: 2 (Moderately disagree)

8. It felt strange talking to the robot
There's no indication in the transcript that the participant found the interaction strange or uncomfortable.
Rating: 3 (Slightly disagree)
