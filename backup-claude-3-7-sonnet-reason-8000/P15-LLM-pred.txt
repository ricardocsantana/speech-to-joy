Let me analyze this conversation transcript to rate the 8 questions appropriately:

1. It was fun talking to the robot
The conversation seems somewhat mechanical, with the robot sometimes interrupting the user or steering the conversation abruptly. The topics were philosophical but the flow wasn't very natural. The user seemed to try to engage but was often cut off. I'd rate this moderately low.

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting
The topic about truth-telling and lying in various circumstances is an interesting ethical topic. The robot did raise some thought-provoking questions, so the content was interesting despite the delivery issues.

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot
The conversation had several instances where the robot didn't let the user finish their thoughts or asked a new question before they could complete their answer. The user often got cut off mid-sentence. This suggests a low satisfaction level.

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot
Given the interrupted responses and somewhat mechanical nature of the interaction, enjoyment seems limited. The user tried to engage but was frequently interrupted.

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation
The robot did ask follow-up questions and attempted to pursue a theme, which shows some engagement. However, it didn't seem to be truly responsive to the user's specific answers.

6. I found the robot fascinating
There's little evidence in the transcript that the robot displayed particularly fascinating behavior. Its conversational style was more functional than impressive.

7. I found the robot boring
The robot wasn't completely boring as it discussed meaningful topics, but its conversation pattern became somewhat predictable.

8. It felt strange talking to the robot
The awkward timing, interruptions, and sometimes non-sequitur questions would likely make this feel strange to most users.

Based on this analysis, I'll now provide the ratings:
