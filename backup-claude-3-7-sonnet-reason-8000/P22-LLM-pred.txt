I need to assign ratings to the 8 questions based solely on the transcript of the conversation between the user and the robot named Alice. Let me analyze the interaction:

1. "It was fun talking to the robot" - The conversation seems quite philosophical about lying and ethics, but the human participant's responses are somewhat brief and they don't appear particularly entertained. Their tone seems neutral to slightly hesitant. They don't express enjoyment directly.

2. "The conversation with the robot was interesting" - The topic about when it's okay to lie is indeed an interesting philosophical question, but the human doesn't seem deeply engaged - their answers are relatively short and sometimes hesitant.

3. "I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot" - The human responds to questions but doesn't show clear satisfaction. The robot sometimes changes topics abruptly or cuts off the human's responses.

4. "I enjoyed talking with the robot" - Similar to question 1, there's no clear indication of enjoyment in the human's responses.

5. "The robot was engaging in the conversation" - The robot does ask follow-up questions and tries to keep the conversation going, but sometimes changes topics abruptly.

6. "I found the robot fascinating" - Nothing in the transcript suggests the human found the robot particularly fascinating.

7. "I found the robot boring" - The human continues the conversation but doesn't show enthusiasm or extensive engagement.

8. "It felt strange talking to the robot" - At the beginning, the human notes "that was direct" when the robot asks about lying, suggesting some discomfort with the interaction style.

Based on these observations, I'll assign ratings that reflect a somewhat neutral to slightly positive experience:
