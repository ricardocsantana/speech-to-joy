I need to rate each of the 8 questions based solely on the transcript of this conversation between the user and the Furhat robot named Alice. Let me analyze how the interaction went:

The conversation was about moral dilemmas regarding lying, truth-telling, and keeping secrets. The robot asked thoughtful questions about when lying might be justified, and the human provided detailed, reflective responses. The conversation had depth and touched on personal examples and hypothetical scenarios.

Now let me rate each question:

1. "It was fun talking to the robot" - The conversation was philosophical and somewhat serious, but the participant seemed engaged and provided thoughtful responses. They didn't explicitly express that it was "fun" but they were clearly willing to engage deeply. I'd say around a 5 (Slightly agree).

2. "The conversation with the robot was interesting" - The topic was certainly interesting and prompted thoughtful reflection from the participant. The philosophical nature of the conversation makes this likely a 6 (Moderately agree).

3. "I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot" - The participant gave detailed answers and the robot responded appropriately in most cases, though there were a few moments where the robot seemed to repeat questions. Overall, probably a 5 (Slightly agree).

4. "I enjoyed talking with the robot" - Similar to question 1, the participant seemed engaged but didn't explicitly express enjoyment. Given their willingness to provide detailed answers, I'd rate this a 5 (Slightly agree).

5. "The robot was engaging in the conversation" - The robot asked follow-up questions and maintained the conversation flow for the most part, though it did repeat a couple of questions. I'd say around a 5 (Slightly agree).

6. "I found the robot fascinating" - There's not strong evidence in the transcript that the participant found the robot itself fascinating, as opposed to the conversation topic. I'd rate this a 4 (Neutral).

7. "I found the robot boring" - The participant engaged consistently throughout the conversation, suggesting they weren't bored. I'd rate this a 2 (Moderately disagree).

8. "It felt strange talking to the robot" - There's no indication in the transcript that the participant felt the interaction was strange or uncomfortable. They spoke naturally and at length. I'd rate this a 3 (Slightly disagree).

Now I'll provide the JSON with these ratings.
