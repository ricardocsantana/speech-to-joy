I need to rate the conversation experience based on the transcript, providing ratings from 1-7 for each of the 8 questions.

From reviewing the transcript, I notice:
- The robot (Alice) is repeatedly asking the user about situations involving lying and ethical dilemmas
- The user often responds with "I can't think of an example right now"
- The conversation feels somewhat repetitive and one-sided
- The robot keeps asking similar questions even when the user doesn't have much to say
- The user gives short answers and doesn't seem very engaged
- The robot doesn't adapt well to the user's responses

Now I'll rate each question:

1. It was fun talking to the robot: The conversation seems rather tedious and repetitive. The user gives short answers and often can't think of examples. Rating: 3

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting: The topic could be interesting (ethics of lying), but the robot keeps asking similar questions. Rating: 4 

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot: The user doesn't seem satisfied given the short answers and frequent "I can't think of an example" responses. Rating: 3

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot: Little evidence of enjoyment in the transcript. Rating: 3

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation: The robot did try to engage with questions, but wasn't responsive to the user's difficulty providing examples. Rating: 4

6. I found the robot fascinating: Nothing indicates the user found the robot particularly fascinating. Rating: 3

7. I found the robot boring: The repetitive questions suggest some boredom. Rating: 5

8. It felt strange talking to the robot: The robot's persistent questioning despite the user's short answers might have felt awkward. Rating: 5
