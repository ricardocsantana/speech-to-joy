I need to rate each of the 8 questions based solely on the transcript of the conversation between the user and the robot named Alice. Let me analyze the conversation:

The robot (Alice) engaged the user in a conversation about truth, lying, and secrets. The conversation seems somewhat one-sided - the robot asks many questions but sometimes interrupts the user or doesn't seem to fully process the user's answers before asking the next question. The robot frequently changed topics and asked follow-up questions that sometimes didn't quite connect to what the user had just said.

Now, let me rate each question:

1. It was fun talking to the robot
   This doesn't seem like a particularly fun conversation. The robot kept pushing somewhat serious ethical questions, interrupted the user, and the flow wasn't very natural. I'd rate this lower.

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting
   The topic of truth and lying is inherently interesting, but the robot's style of questioning was somewhat disjointed. Still, there were some thought-provoking questions.

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot
   The conversation had issues with flow and the robot seemed to ignore some of the user's responses, which would likely reduce satisfaction.

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot
   Similar to #1, the conversation doesn't appear particularly enjoyable. The robot kept pushing somewhat uncomfortable ethical questions about lying.

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation
   The robot did ask many questions, but didn't seem to fully engage with the answers. It kept the conversation going but not in a natural way.

6. I found the robot fascinating
   The robot's behavior (interrupting, moving to new questions without acknowledging answers) might be seen as more frustrating than fascinating.

7. I found the robot boring
   The robot wasn't boring in terms of topic selection, but the conversation style might have been tedious.

8. It felt strange talking to the robot
   Based on the transcript, the conversation flow was unnatural, with the robot sometimes not processing the user's responses properly, which would likely feel strange.

Based on this analysis, here are my ratings:
