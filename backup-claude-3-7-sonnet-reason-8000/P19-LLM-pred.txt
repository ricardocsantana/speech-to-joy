I need to rate the user's experience based solely on the transcript of their conversation with a Furhat robot on 8 questions using a 1-7 scale.

Let me analyze the conversation:

1. It was fun talking to the robot
   The conversation appears to be quite philosophical and in-depth. The user engages extensively with the robot's questions about lying, providing thoughtful and detailed responses. The conversation seems substantive but not necessarily "fun" in a lighthearted sense. The user seems engaged but not explicitly enjoying themselves in a fun way. I'd say around 5 (slightly agree).

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting
   The conversation covered moral dilemmas about lying, personal examples, and ethical considerations. These are intellectually stimulating topics, and the user provides lengthy, thoughtful responses, suggesting they found the topic interesting. Rating: 6 (moderately agree).

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot
   The user had the opportunity to share their thoughts extensively, and the robot asked follow-up questions that built on previous responses. However, the robot cut the user off at the end. Overall, the conversation seemed satisfactory but ended abruptly. Rating: 5 (slightly agree).

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot
   Similar to question 1, the user engaged thoroughly, but there's no explicit indication of enjoyment. The serious nature of the conversation and the user's detailed responses suggest they were at least somewhat engaged. Rating: 5 (slightly agree).

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation
   The robot asked thoughtful follow-up questions that built on what the user said, showing it was listening and responding appropriately. It kept the conversation flowing and prompted deeper reflection. Rating: 6 (moderately agree).

6. I found the robot fascinating
   There's no explicit indication that the user found the robot itself fascinating, though they did engage with its questions. The focus seems to be on the content of the conversation rather than fascination with the robot. Rating: 4 (neutral).

7. I found the robot boring
   The user continued to provide detailed responses throughout the conversation, suggesting they weren't bored. The robot maintained their interest with follow-up questions. Rating: 2 (moderately disagree).

8. It felt strange talking to the robot
   There's no indication in the transcript that the user found the interaction strange or uncomfortable. They responded naturally and extensively. Rating: 3 (slightly disagree).

Based on this analysis, here are my ratings:
