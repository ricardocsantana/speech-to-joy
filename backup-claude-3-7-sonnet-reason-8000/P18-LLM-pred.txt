I need to analyze this conversation and assign ratings for each of the 8 questions based on how a human participant would likely feel after this interaction with the Furhat robot named Alice.

Looking at the transcript, the conversation was about honesty, lying, and storytelling - particularly in relation to children. The robot seemed to have some challenges in following the conversation flow, and there were moments where the user appeared frustrated (saying "for fuck's sake" multiple times).

Let me analyze each question:

1. It was fun talking to the robot - The user seemed frustrated at points, and there's little evidence they found it fun. They were terse in many responses and showed signs of irritation.
Rating: 2 (Moderately disagree)

2. The conversation with the robot was interesting - The topic was potentially interesting (ethics of lying), but the robot seemed to struggle to maintain a coherent conversation flow and kept redirecting when the user tried to express thoughts.
Rating: 3 (Slightly disagree)

3. I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot - Based on the user's frustration, short answers, and expressions like "for fuck's sake," they did not seem satisfied.
Rating: 2 (Moderately disagree)

4. I enjoyed talking with the robot - Similar to #1, there's little evidence of enjoyment and several signs of frustration.
Rating: 2 (Moderately disagree)

5. The robot was engaging in the conversation - The robot did try to ask follow-up questions, but often seemed to miss the user's points or interrupt them.
Rating: 3 (Slightly disagree)

6. I found the robot fascinating - The transcript doesn't show any indication that the user found the robot particularly fascinating.
Rating: 3 (Slightly disagree)

7. I found the robot boring - The user didn't explicitly indicate boredom, but their frustration suggests they weren't positively engaged.
Rating: 5 (Slightly agree)

8. It felt strange talking to the robot - The user's difficulty maintaining the conversation and their apparent frustration suggest some discomfort with the interaction.
Rating: 6 (Moderately agree)
