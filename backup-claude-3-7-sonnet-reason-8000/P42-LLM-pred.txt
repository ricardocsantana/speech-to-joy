I need to rate the user's experience with the robot based on the transcript. Let me analyze the conversation:

1. **Conversation Flow**: The robot asks a series of questions about lying, keeping secrets, and related ethical situations. The conversation flows fairly well, with the robot following up on the user's responses, though there are a couple instances where the robot repeats questions the user already answered.

2. **Engagement**: The robot keeps the conversation going with follow-up questions, showing some level of engagement with the user's responses.

3. **User Responses**: The user gives thoughtful answers and seems willing to engage with the robot.

4. **Issues**: At a couple points, the robot asks about topics the user already addressed, showing some lack of attentiveness. For example, around 5:35 the user points out "I already answered that."

Now let me rate each question:

1. **It was fun talking to the robot**: The conversation was on a somewhat serious topic (lying/ethics), but seemed to flow well. The user engaged throughout. I'd rate this moderately positive.

2. **The conversation with the robot was interesting**: The topic was substantive and the questions prompted reflection, so I'd rate this quite high.

3. **I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot**: The conversation flowed well overall, but the robot did repeat questions, which the user pointed out. This would reduce satisfaction somewhat.

4. **I enjoyed talking with the robot**: Similar to #1, the user seemed engaged but the topic wasn't necessarily "enjoyable" per se.

5. **The robot was engaging in the conversation**: The robot asked follow-up questions based on responses, showing some level of engagement.

6. **I found the robot fascinating**: Based on the transcript, the robot showed some conversational abilities but also had clear limitations (repeating questions).

7. **I found the robot boring**: The conversation covered interesting ethical ground, so probably not boring.

8. **It felt strange talking to the robot**: There are some unnatural elements in the conversation that might make it feel strange.

Based on this analysis, I'll rate each question on the 1-7 scale:
