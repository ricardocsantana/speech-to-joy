I need to rate each of the 8 questions based solely on the transcript. Let me analyze the conversation:

1. **It was fun talking to the robot**
The conversation was quite philosophical and thoughtful, discussing ethical dilemmas. The user engaged well and provided detailed responses. There's no explicit indication they found it "fun" per se, but they did seem engaged. The topic was serious rather than light-hearted. I'd say around a 5-6 rating.

2. **The conversation with the robot was interesting**
The topic of robot ethics, medical autonomy, and difficult decisions seemed quite interesting and the user provided thoughtful, lengthy responses. They seemed intellectually engaged. I'd rate this highly, around a 6-7.

3. **I was satisfied with my conversation with the robot**
The robot maintained a good conversation flow, asked thoughtful follow-up questions, and acknowledged the user's points. The conversation had depth. There were no apparent frustrations. Rating around 6.

4. **I enjoyed talking with the robot**
Similar to "fun," but more about general enjoyment. The user engaged deeply and continued the conversation voluntarily. They shared a personal story when prompted. This suggests they were comfortable and likely enjoyed the intellectual exchange. Rating around 6.

5. **The robot was engaging in the conversation**
The robot asked good follow-up questions, acknowledged the user's points, and kept the conversation flowing with relevant and thought-provoking topics. Rating around 6-7.

6. **I found the robot fascinating**
The robot presented interesting ethical dilemmas and followed up on the user's responses intelligently. There's no direct indication the user found the robot itself fascinating, but the conversation topics were engaging. Rating around 5-6.

7. **I found the robot boring**
This is the opposite of engaging/fascinating. The conversation had depth and the user gave detailed responses, suggesting they weren't bored. Rating would be low, around 2-3.

8. **It felt strange talking to the robot**
There's no indication in the transcript that the user felt uncomfortable or strange. When asked about gaining trust, they discussed others' potential discomfort with robots but didn't express any personal discomfort. They seemed at ease discussing complex topics. Rating around 3-4.

Based on this analysis, here are my ratings:
